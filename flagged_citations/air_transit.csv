92,ca7c477cc227e39e,2.32(c)(1),,False,PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.,"Two baboon enclosures had loops of water lines entering the cage from the top at the time of inspection. The
waterlines were attached to the source and to the cage at the water nipple. This created a loop of water line
sufficiently large for the animals to put a head through and possibly cause strangulation. Facility personnel
immediately removed the water lines from the enclosure when they were pointed out by USDA personnel and the
animal staff was instructed to assure the cages were pulled away from the water line origin to prevent the lines from
being reintroduced to the cages. Two more Baboons had enrichment devices attached to the front of their
enclosures by a rope that was sufficiently long that it could be pulled into the enclosure (but not the enrichment
device). This would create a loop of rope sufficiently large that a head or limb could be passed through and become
entrapped. Personnel must ensure that the enclosures in which animals are placed do not contribute to these risks.
Correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to handle animals and equipment in a manner that takes
into account the special capabilities and behaviors of the animals.
Two racks of rabbit enclosures, containing six rabbits each, had water nipples that did not fully reach into the
cage. The animal care staff had not noticed that the nipples did not break the plane of the back of the cage where
they were supposed to come into the cage through a hole approximately one and a half inches in diameter. The
staff had provided water bottles to two of the animals as an addition to the nipples. Having the nipple essentially
recessed into a small hole makes it difficult for the animal to easily access fresh water and could cause stress in the
animal and possibly lead to dehydration. Correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to monitor that the
basic needs of each animal are easily accessible.
One cat, that had recently had surgery, was noted to be in an enclosure that contained an Elizabethan collar.
The collar was not on the animal even though the surgical record said an E-collar would be used and did not have

to animal injury. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained to assure post-procedural care is provided and
documented as directed.
Immediate post-procedural care was outlined in the protocols for two animals but there was no documentation of
these procedures being performed by the investigative staff. An anesthesia record was present but did not indicate
any animal information past the discontinuation of anesthesia or for the remainder of the procedure day. Animal
number 23161 had no immediate post-procedural record and animal number 444 also had no immediate
post-procedural record and facility personnel stated that the procedure may go as late as 8 PM at which point the
animal would be returned to its enclosure. Failure to complete proper post-procedural care could lead to animals
experiencing unnecessary pain or distress and, often, the only way to monitor that the investigators are following the
standards approved by the IACUC is by records review. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained and

documented signs of pain that were not appropriately addressed by the surgery personal of the principal
investigator.
Sheep B3379 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. During
the cardiac bypass there was a notation that the animal was kicking. A paralytic was administered with the
analgesic and increase in the anesthetic agent. As stated in the protocol the analgesia and anesthetic should be
allowed to bring the animal to plane III anesthesia before the administration or re-administration of a paralytic to
ensure the animal is not experiencing pain during the surgical procedure.
Sheep B3382 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. Both the
heart rate and the blood pressure increased after the cardiac bypass and remained at that level until the end of the
surgery, about 45 minutes. The heart rate increased from an average of 73 to 106 and the blood pressure
increased from an average of 79/50 to 102/76. During the 45 minute period with the elevated heart rate and blood
pressure the gas anesthetic was decreased from 2% to 1% for the last 30 minutes. No additional analgesics were
administered during this 45 minute period. An additional dose of paralytic drug had been given during the cardiac
bypass so the sheep would have been under the influence of the paralytic. Pain was then not appropriately
addressed in this sheep, the sheep should have received an agent for pain relief which would lead to a decrease
the heart rate and blood pressure.
Sheep B3386 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/13/14. After the
incision the average heart rate increased from 92 to 144 and the average blood pressure increased from 83/61 to
119/101. An analgesic was given to decrease the pain and the resulting high blood pressure. Five minutes later
the heart rate was 149 and the blood pressure 112/91. Metoprolol (not an analgesic or anesthetic) was given to
decrease the high heart rate and blood pressure. The use of Metoprolol was not included in the protocol. Eight
minutes later the heart rate was 103 and the blood pressure was 106/79 and an additional dose of the paralytic drug
was administered. The cardiac bypass was initiated four minutes later. As the protocol indicates, an increase in
heart rate and blood pressure indicates perception of pain by the animal. The increase in heart rate and blood
pressure were considered signs that the sheep was experiencing pain. Giving a drug that affects heart rate and
blood pressure prevents these parameters from being used to monitor pain when paralytics are used. The sheep
did not have its pain addressed before additional paralytic was given.
Paralytic agents prevent the animal from moving even if it experiences pain. Heart rate and blood pressure often
increase when animals experience pain and are therefore used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia in lieu of muscle
responses such as eye twitch. When heart rate and blood pressure rise during anesthesia, additional pain relieving
(analgesic) and/or anesthetic agent are necessary to assure the animal is not experiencing pain. This is especially
important in animals that are unable to respond due to a paralytic agent. Based on the examples above, the
veterinary guidance on use of paralytics to include monitoring with appropriate response does not appear to be
adequate as required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. Each research facility veterinarian must provide
guidance on appropriate monitoring and subsequent treatment by personnel involved in handling, immobilization,
anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia. This assures the least pain and distress is felt by the animals.

Ketamine and 0.6 mg/kg of Xylazine have been used on a majority of animals for imaging procedures that require
immobilization but do not require a surgical plane of anesthesia. The lower dosages of anesthetic were developed in
conjunction with the clinical veterinarian, but the protocol was not amended and approved by the IACUC, as
required for this significant change. Additionally, the newly approved version of this protocol (effective 3/24/16) still
contains only the higher dosage of these drugs for all procedures, despite the fact that this is not what is currently
being used for the non-invasive procedures.
Making significant changes to animal use protocols without IACUC review and approval could be detrimental to the
animals, as the review process allows consideration of the best methods to minimize pain and distress.
If the lower dosage is to be used for some procedures, then the current protocol should be amended and approved

water were offered at 15:00 CEST in Amsterdam, prior to a scheduled departure at 17:00 CEST. There was a 36

on July 26th reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit at Schiphol International Airport in Amsterdam, and at 16:00 CEST it
was 86 degrees. The temperature was 81 degrees Fahrenheit at Boston Logan International Airport. At 19:38 EDT,
the KLM duty manager on the aircraft notified the intermediate handler that there was a deceased pet on board the
aircraft.
Post-mortem findings revealed that this animal was at high risk for heat stroke due to the unique upper airway
anatomy of brachycephalic breeds like French bulldogs. The necropsy report concludes that the cause of death was
respiratory distress and heat stroke.
While in transport, this animal was subjected to a combination of temperature and time that was detrimental to the

Failure to provide protection from the direct rays of the sun as well as exposure to temperatures above 85 degrees

detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

were wooden crates, individually housing 4 nonhuman primates per crate, with handles located on each end. In the
beginning of the transfer, two employees utilized both ends of the transport enclosure to simultaneously lift each end of
the enclosure together (one employee at each end), keeping the enclosure level to load them onto the ground transport
trailer. During the course of transferring the transport enclosures from the pallet trailer to the ground transport conveyance
trailer, the attendants began to work individually to grab only one end of the transport enclosure and drag it across the
pallet trailer. The pallet trailer was lower in height by approximately 10-12 inches than the ground transportation trailer’s
floor, so then, when working individually, the handlers began dragging and tilting the transport enclosures from the lower
pallet trailer up into the ground transport trailer, and dropping the end being dragged onto the floor of the ground transport
trailer.
Any person handling a primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate must use care and avoid excessively tilting or
dragging their enclosures which may cause physical harm or distress to the nonhuman primates.
Proper handling procedures must be followed when handling primary enclosures containing nonhuman primates so they
must not be dropped or needlessly tilted and must not be stacked in a manner that may reasonably be expected to result
in its falling. It must also be handled and positioned in the manner that written instructions and arrows on the outside of

Information was received by APHIS Animal Care in November 2016 that Cabo Verde Airlines was transporting
animals into the Providence, RI airport housed inside kennels that were transported as cargo in the hold of the
planes. Although there were no animals in transit on the incoming flight or the outgoing flight on the day of the
inspection, several personnel at the Cabo Verde Airlines ticket counter acknowledged that dogs have in fact been
transported as cargo in kennels inside the hold of the planes on both incoming and outgoing flights through the
Providence airport.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the transportation of animals as cargo by air is an activity regulated by the
Animal Welfare Act and a valid USDA registration as a Class “T” carrier is required. Carriers that transport animals
as cargo must be registered with the USDA to ensure compliance with the transportation standards and to ensure
the welfare of the animals being transported.
The airline must complete the new registration form that will be sent by the Regional Office and then promptly return
it to the Eastern Regional Office for processing prior to any further transportation of animals by the airline.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.",True,True

38740,30e629bdf9b116b0,2.25(a),,False,Requirements and procedures.,"During an inspection at RDU airport, the inspector learned that animals moving from above-wing to below-wing for two
airlines were being handled by an intermediate group, Superior. Subsequent conversations with Superior personnel
revealed that they are not currently registered as a handler with USDA Animal Care. The employee stated that Superior
will immediately apply for a registration. Handling animals in an airport moving from above-wing to below-wing without the
required regulatory oversight can lead to unregulated handling of animals, putting the animals at risk of unnecessary
behavioral stress, trauma, escape, physical harm, or loss of life. The regulations require that each carrier and
intermediate handler register with the Secretary by completing and filing a properly executed form which will be furnished,
upon request, by the Deputy Administrator.
Conducting regulated activity without a valid registration violates the Federal Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activity can be conducted until a valid registration certificate is issued by USDA Animal Care.
