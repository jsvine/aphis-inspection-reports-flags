and the cage wash staff and was sent through the cage wash. At the time the animal was found the carcass was

flight. At SFO the passenger became incapacitated, and was not allowed to board the connecting flight. At that
point the cat was tagged as luggage (Tag # 401 6394 548), and went to the cargo facility, around 5:30 PM.
Subsequently, after some confusion about whether the owner would be collecting the cat from the cargo office, cat
was shipped in cargo on a United flight the next day at 10:30 AM to SEA, where it was reunited with the owner.
The Animal Welfare Act regulations require that carriers not accept dogs and cats for transport unless feeding and
watering instructions are obtained in writing from the person shipping the animal. In this instance no feeding and
watering instructions could be obtained. In this event, per 3.13(f), the carrier must continue to provide proper care,
feeding, and housing to the dog or cat, and maintain the dog or cat in accordance with generally accepted
professional and husbandry practices for the time that the animal remains in the carrier(cid:25)s possession, during efforts
to contact the owner.
Feeding requirements for an adult cat are at minimum every 24 hours per the regulations, but without instructions,
and without knowing when an animal was last offered food and water the airline should assume that the animal may
need food and water, and those should be supplied to the animal in order to safeguard its well-being. This cat was
not offered food, and it had been well over 24 hours since the animal began the trip from Japan by the time the
animal arrived at SEA.
The carrier should develop clear policies on how they handle these cases so as to ensure proper care. The carrier
should be equipped with supplies so as to be able to provide proper husbandry in cases where the kenneling
service is not used.
Additionally, 3.13(f) requires that efforts to contact the owner be documented, and this information should be
obviously apparent to any staff members responsible for caring for the animal. This information was not immediately
available, and created confusion about the status of the animal for incoming AM staff. Such confusion, combined
with the absence of feeding and watering instructions, could endanger the animal's welfare. Staff should ensure
documentation and communication to help safeguard the welfare of the animals.

this change. The protocol states that rabbits are housed at a satellite location while undergoing experimental procedures;
the protocol states that the primary enclosure type for the rabbits at this satellite location is “dog carrier” and primary
enclosure size is “24 x 17.5 x 18.5” inches. Based on conversations with facility staff and a visit to the satellite location, it
is evident that rabbits are being housed in significantly smaller dog carriers which do not provide the minimum amount of
space required under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). At the time of the inspection, 6 rabbits were housed in identical
transport crates at the satellite location. The crates are 12 inches tall, which is 2 inches short of the AWA requirements.
The floor space provided by the crates is 20 inches long x 11 inches wide / 144 = 1.52 square feet; this is adequate for
rabbits under 2 kilograms (who require 1.5 square feet of space) but is not adequate for rabbits weighing 2-4 kilograms
(who require 3.0 square feet). Some of the rabbits used in the study weight less than 2 kilograms, but others weigh
between 2 and 4 kilograms. According to facility staff, the animals live in the crates at the satellite location for about 24

escaped from her transport enclosure and was injured on 7/30/2021. The animal was in the pet holding area awaiting
transport on flight 3483 from Seattle to Reno. She was contained in a large plastic “Vari-kennel” type transport enclosure.
The dog was not observed escaping from the enclosure, but was seen running loose by an airport employee. The dog
chewed through the plastic cable tie fasteners used to secure the metal door, forced open the kennel door and escaped
the transport enclosure. She then ran across the tarmac, jumped a fence, and went onto a street outside of the airport
secured area. She was found injured and bleeding by a person who took the dog to a local veterinary hospital for care.
According to one of the veterinarians that treated “Bella” at the clinic, the dog was bleeding from her mouth, had
lacerations to the pads on all four paws, and her nails were broken. The animal was treated and released to the owners
the following day.
Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must be constructed so that the enclosure is strong enough to contain the
animals securely and comfortably and to withstand the normal rigors of transportation, thus preventing their possible
escape and injury.

discovered in the enclosure of a Red-Tailed Hawk that was adjacent to where the porcupine was housed with it’s
dam. Both the porcupines and the Red-Tailed Hawk were housed in chain-link enclosures while the shared wall
between the two enclosures was modified with wire, vinyl slats, and corrugated plastic so as to prevent contact
between the porcupines and the hawk. Additionally, there are vinyl slats on the wall of the enclosure facing the
aisle in front of the two enclosures and, for management purposes, the Red-Tailed Hawk is tethered within it’s own
enclosure.
The carcass was heavily predated upon when found during the facility’s morning checks and while there were no
open gates to either enclosure and the shared wall was in good repair, it was determined at necropsy that the width
of the head and chest of the porcupine were 38mm and 52mm, respectively. Further inspection of the enclosures
revealed that the gaps between the gates and the door jambs were approximately 50mm of both of the enclosures.
The most likely scenario is that the juvenile porcupine, already identified by the facility as smaller than previous
juvenile porcupines housed in this enclosure, was able to exit the enclosure in the gap of the door jamb, travel down
the aisle, and then enter the enclosure of the adjacent Red-Tailed Hawk through a similar-sized door jamb, where it
was then attacked by the hawk.
In response to the incident, the facility reviewed all enclosures and identified no other animals or enclosures that
presented a similar risk in which an animal would be able to escape through a door jamb. Also, any change in
inhabitants of the enclosures will result in a similar review of animal size and door jamb width to ensure that new
animals introduced will also not be able to escape. Modified chain-link enclosures will no longer be used to house
pregnant porcupines. Instead, they and their young will be housed in enclosures with a maximum wire and door
gap width of 1in (25.4mm).
All indoor and outdoor facilities need to be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and be constructed in such
a manner as to contain the animals. Failure to do so can result in injury or death to the animal.

outdoor enclosures to a heated barn due to the cold weather. The licensee is near completion of constructing a
second, heated barn since the one does not have enough space to house all the licensee's birds and primates.
Due to space constraints in the barn, the licensee housed one pair of adult ring-tailed lemurs in a medium-sized dog
travel crate and another pair of ring-tailed lemurs (with an infant) in a large dog travel crate. The medium crate was
21 inches tall and provided 2.9 square feet of floor space. The large crate provided 5.1 square feet of floor space
and was 30 inches tall. Adult lemurs are required to be housed in enclosures which are at least 30 inches tall and
provide each adult with at least 3 square feet of floor space. Therefore, the medium crate was too small and too
short for even one ring-tailed lemur. The large crate provided the minimum amount of space required for one lemur,
but did not provide adequate space for the two adults housed in it. Primates require sufficient space to allow them
to make normal postural adjustments for their health and well-being.
** The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures provide each nonhuman primate with the minimum floor space
and height required by the regulations. Specifically, each ring-tailed lemur must have at least 3.0 square feet of
floor space (6.0 square feet if there are two adults) and at least 30 inches of height in their primary enclosures. TO

individual primary enclosures. The four enclosures had tape applied to the exterior that sealed all ventilation
openings on the enclosures. Removal of the externally applied tape on one enclosure revealed the openings had

ventilation requirement: when there are ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary enclosure the
ventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each wall.
By sealing the openings on all four sides of the enclosures the animals were essentially provided with no openings
for ventilation. Insufficient ventilation during transportation will compromise animal well being by restricting oxygen
and could result in death of the animal. Animals must not be accepted for transportation when housed in primary

closed. These are signs of obvious discomfort and painful eye conditions. The 14 year old South American Sea
Lion Kitty has a cloudy right eye. Her veterinary exam done on 2-1-16 did not indicate any eye issues and stated
she was fluorescein negative. During the photo shoots Kitty was seen squinting her eyes as at 5:30 pm the three
sea lions being used for photos were looking directly into the setting sun due to the orientation of the trailer set up.
Sea lions, especially those with eye issues, should never be made to look directly into the sun.
During most of this inspection, Zoey (13 year old California sea lion) was holding her right eye closed. There is no
record of any veterinary consultation or initiation of medical treatment. The pH of the outdoor pool at the time of
inspection was 7 but may have been much lower as the testing method only goes as low as 7. The sea lions had
not been placed in this pool yet. The caretaker added soda to bring the pH up, but varying pHs of the water can be
affecting the eyes.
A medical record dated 6-26-15 stated Zoey had her eye tightly closed (record does not state which eye). There is
no notation of a veterinary consultation, but Muro drops (hypertonic saline) was given 3 times daily for several days
along with oral 500 mg amoxicillin. The record states the cloudiness left. Two months later the medical record
shows the closed eye happened again but does not state which eye, and does not state if the veterinarian was
consulted. This animal is having recurrent, chronic eye probles which are not being adequately addressed and
treated properly.
Lilly, a talkative 3 year old California sea lion, was holding her left eye closed or squinting during much of this
inspection. The veterinary exam of Lilly on 2-1-16 indicated corneal opacities on both eyes.
There is gentamicin ophthalmic drops in the medical cabinet and the caretaker stated it is used on Zoey when her
eyes are cloudy. There is no script on the bottle or in the medical records as to when to use this.
The veterinarian prescribed all the sea lions have easy access to salt water. This is not being done as the level
today is zero. The veterinarian also found titers for Leptospirosis on Zoey and Kitty and recommended further
testing to see if any active infection was occurring or if it was vaccine related. There is no indication the follow up
diagnostics were done.
All of these sea lions need to have a thorough eye evaluation by a veterinarian to treat for any lesions and specific
protocols need to be in place for medical treatments of eyes. This traveling exhibit has a bright blue pool with no
shade, no shade on the stage and the stage was set up to face the sun at this location. Changes in their
environment need to be made to correct any eye irritations and to prevent further eye diseases.

-Male Pug “Hopper” (enclosure #8975, microchip #900239877798975) had an enlarged right eye protruding from the eye
socket. The sclera is red with prominent blood vessels. The surface of the eye appears dark in color, thickened and rough
in texture, and is opaque; the normal structures of the eye cannot be seen. The enlarged globe and thickening of the
surface of the eye are consistent with a chronic disease or injury. There is a focal area ~5mm in diameter of bright red
color on the thickened dark surface of the eye.
-Female French Bulldog “Taylor” (enclosure #8495, microchip #900239877798495) was observed by inspectors to have
several medical issues. When initially observed, she was lying down, quiet, and shivering in the back of her enclosure and
appeared to be breathing heavily. She did not stand or come to the front of the enclosure. When viewed outside of the
enclosure, she demonstrated increased respiratory effort. Her right eye had a small focal opacity, and her left eye had an
irregular surface with a creamy discharge present. She walked stiffly with an abnormal gait and there was a small red
wound on her left hind leg, which she was observed to hold up intermittently while standing. Her genitalia was swollen and
dark in color.
-Female Pug “Emma” crate #8980 microchip #900239877798980 was observed to be quiet and not moving around her
enclosure. She was not observed to stand. When she was removed from the enclosure by the intermediate handler, she
walked with an abnormal gait and appeared to have trouble bearing weight on her hind limbs. When bearing weight on
her right hind leg, it would often slip under her body, causing her to stumble or fall.
It is the responsibility of the transporter to observe the dogs as frequently as possible to ensure no dogs are ill, injured, or
in physical distress and to provide care accordingly. If a dog is obviously ill, injured or in physical distress, it must not be
transported in commerce, except to receive veterinary care for the condition.

waybill #074-27691145. According to documentation accompanying the animal, the dog was observed and food and
water were offered at 15:00 CEST in Amsterdam, prior to a scheduled departure at 17:00 CEST. There was a 36
minute flight delay, according to publicly available flight information, and the plane departed the gate at 17:36
CEST, taking off at 17:57 CEST. This flight landed at Boston Logan International airport at 18:45 EDT after a flight
time of 7 hours and 20 minutes, and the plane arrived at the gate in Boston at 18:56 EDT. Recorded temperatures
on July 26th reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit at Schiphol International Airport in Amsterdam, and at 16:00 CEST it
was 86 degrees. The temperature was 81 degrees Fahrenheit at Boston Logan International Airport. At 19:38 EDT,
the KLM duty manager on the aircraft notified the intermediate handler that there was a deceased pet on board the
aircraft.
Post-mortem findings revealed that this animal was at high risk for heat stroke due to the unique upper airway
anatomy of brachycephalic breeds like French bulldogs. The necropsy report concludes that the cause of death was
respiratory distress and heat stroke.
While in transport, this animal was subjected to a combination of temperature and time that was detrimental to the
animal's health, especially considering the known susceptibility of this breed to heat-related health problems. The
combination of these climatic conditions, compounded with known risk factors associated with this breed of dog,
resulted in the death of this animal. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being,
appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. An animal may never be subjected

Istanbul (IST) on flight TK420 with a final destination in Los Angeles (LAX) on flight TK179. The flight time was
approximately 19 to 20 hours, excluding wait times and loading and unloading of the cats. Documents provided show the
2 Sphynx cats were alive in IST prior to boarding for LAX. Although the Turkish airlines representative stated
temperatures in airplane cargo ranges from 59 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (F), the temperature, altitude, flight time, and
cabin temperature values can vary between the minimum and the maximum values, depending on the amount and type of
cargo. Therefore, short temperature deviations may occur during flight.
On November 17, the temperature In Moscow ranged between 27-34 degrees F, 85% Humidity (H), in Istanbul 48-59
degrees F, 78% H, and at LAX, upon arrival between 10 and 11 am ranged between 50-71 degrees F, 61% H. According
to the registered handler, upon offloading from the plane, the 2 Sphynx kittens were dead. The deceased cats were in the
crate lined with a litter pad with fecal matter on their bodies. There were no indications of added measures taken to
protect the cats or reduce the effects from the potential rigors of travel including temperature fluctuations during this
transport.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time, that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's
age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.

disrepair and damaged. There were sharp broken wires protruding into the enclosures. The sharp wires protruding

animal caretaker that unloaded the trailer also stated that when he was unloading the shipment and picked up a
crate the bottom fell out and all of the guinea pigs within fell out too. Traveling in structurally unsafe enclosures can

2013. The license was cancelled by the Department due to failure to renew by the owner. A search of Health
Certificates records in 2014 revealed the potential shipping of puppies from this location.
Animal Care staff met with the owner at the kennel on June 18, 2014. During that meeting the owner stated that he
had been selling and shipping puppies in sight unseen transactions. At that meeting, he stated that he now knew
and understood the regulations requiring a license in order to sell puppies in that manner and further stated that he
would no longer ship puppies or do sight unseen transactions. He also stated that if, in the future he decided to
resume shipping, he would apply for a license.
A recent search of records of animals shipped through South Bend Airport revealed the shipping of at least 6
animals between March 2016 and February 2017 from this kennel.
The number of adult female dogs (approximately 120 -130) on site is greater than the limit to be considered exempt
from the licensing requirements.
The sale and shipment of animals from a facility with more than 4 females requires a valid license.
Failure to be licensed results in a lack of oversight on the kennel operation by the Department. The Department is
responsible for ensuring that all animals are raised and sold in a manner that maintains their health and safety.
Immediately cease and desist the shipment of animals and the sale of any animal sight unseen until a valid license
has been issued by the Department.
An application was given to the kennel owner during this site visit.

Per this Section of the Regulations, any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to
exhibit any animal at any location other than the person's approved site shall submit a written itinerary that shall be
received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel. The itinerary shall contain
complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location
other than the person's approved site and shall include the names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the
animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited, including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for
any stops and layovers that allow or require removal of the animals from the transport enclosures.
The itinerary must also include the name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal
for exhibition purposes, including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the
event that any animal is leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who
owns such animal; and the name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific
name), sex and age of each animal that will be in travel status.
Complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of the animals when a licensee is in travel status is
necessary in order to know the location of the licensee to ensure that inspections can be conducted when required
in order to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA and to assess the facility and animals.
The licensee needs to submit an itinerary to the Fort Collins Office that contains complete and accurate information
as outlined in all of Section 2.126 (c) (1) concerning the identification of all animals and locations while in travel
status.

injury to the guinea pigs. On some of the travel enclosures the wire had been separated from the wooden supports
and there were openings through which guinea pigs may escape. An employee stated that there were several
guinea pigs loose in the transport trailer when it arrived at the facility. The animal caretaker stated that when he was

28191,0c0ec99325e7086e,3.133,Direct,False,Separation.,"There are three adult red foxes (a red and black male approximately 2 years old, a white and black female approximately
3 years old, and a champagne colored male approximately 3 years old) are housed in a single enclosure. The group of
red foxes demonstrated compatibility issues during today’s inspection. The champagne colored male appeared to be thin
indicated by his visible hip and shoulder bones along with an accentuated waist. The red and black male is displaying
dominant behavior over the champagne by snarling and teeth bearing, vocalization, staring, chasing, food-guarding
behaviors and trapping the champagne male in a plastic animal travel carrier. At one point during inspection, inspectors
witnessed the red and black male jumping on top of the carrier, pawing at the roof, and staring down the champagne male
(hiding in the carrier). Inspectors also witnessed the black and white female approach the champagne male while he was
hiding in the carrier, snarl and growl at him and then walk away. The champagne male fox primarily stays inside the
plastic animal travel carrier that was placed in the enclosure about 5 days ago after the licensee noticed the stressed
behavior of the older adult champagned colored male. When the champagne male briefly ventured out of the shelter, he
kept his tail low to the ground, walked in a small, crouched position near the carrier. As soon as the red and black male
jumped onto the adjacent play structure and stood on higher ground, the champagne fox quickly ran back into the crate.
The Licensee indicated that she had observed these behaviors for about one month and had plans of re-homing the
younger red and black male fox. However, the re-homing process had not been initiated at the time of inspection.
The constant intimidation and dominant behavior displayed by the younger red and black male fox over the older
champagne male fox is leading to significant stress and discomfort among all animals contained within the enclosure. This
can lead to a decrease in food consumption, weight loss, psychological stress, and self-injurious coping behavior such as
paw biting or overgrooming.
Correct by separating incompatible animals and housing them in enclosures that are far enough away that they do not
interfere with the health or wellbeing of each other. Additionally, all animals in this enclosure must be evaluated by a
veterinarian to address all physical and behavioral issues.

enclosures which measure 4 feet high by 8 feet square. The tigers are able to stand up, turn around, and lie down
without interfering with their cagemate(s); one male tiger was seen sitting in an erect position and had to hunch his
head to avoid hitting the ceiling of the cage. However, these enclosures do not allow the animals to perform normal
species-appropriate postural behaviors such as stretching to their full vertical height, climb, or perch. During the
inspection, the ten tigers performing in the act were seen in their enclosures from 10:30 AM until the 5:30 PM show
time. They were not taken out of their enclosures or allowed into the show ring for exercise or training at any time
during the day. The three additional tigers are juveniles in training, according to the owner, and they are brought out
into the ring for 20-25 minute training sessions 1-2 times each day. There is no other enclosure or pen of any type

enclosures used while on travel do not allow the animals to perform their normal postural adjustments, including
stretching and perching, in a non-training environment, the animals may experience physical discomfort or
psychological stress. In addition to individual effects, the fact that the tigers are housed in groups can present

The animals were offloaded from the plane at 10:30 AM onto a pallet trailer and then completely loaded onto the ground
transportation trailers by 12:05 PM without any shade provided. The ambient temperature was 86 degrees Fahrenheit at
10:30 AM and rose to 87 degrees Fahrenheit by the time they were fully loaded onto the ground transport at 12:05 PM. In

continue loading the enclosures.
Failure to provide protection from the direct rays of the sun as well as exposure to temperatures above 85 degrees
Fahrenheit for more than 45 minutes could cause the nonhuman primates to become overheated, which could have a
detrimental impact on their health and well-being.
The registrant must ensure that all nonhuman primates have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun

were wooden crates, individually housing 4 nonhuman primates per crate, with handles located on each end. In the
beginning of the transfer, two employees utilized both ends of the transport enclosure to simultaneously lift each end of
the enclosure together (one employee at each end), keeping the enclosure level to load them onto the ground transport
trailer. During the course of transferring the transport enclosures from the pallet trailer to the ground transport conveyance
trailer, the attendants began to work individually to grab only one end of the transport enclosure and drag it across the
pallet trailer. The pallet trailer was lower in height by approximately 10-12 inches than the ground transportation trailer’s
floor, so then, when working individually, the handlers began dragging and tilting the transport enclosures from the lower
pallet trailer up into the ground transport trailer, and dropping the end being dragged onto the floor of the ground transport
trailer.
Any person handling a primary enclosure containing a nonhuman primate must use care and avoid excessively tilting or
dragging their enclosures which may cause physical harm or distress to the nonhuman primates.
Proper handling procedures must be followed when handling primary enclosures containing nonhuman primates so they
must not be dropped or needlessly tilted and must not be stacked in a manner that may reasonably be expected to result
in its falling. It must also be handled and positioned in the manner that written instructions and arrows on the outside of
the primary enclosure indicate.

trailer for a period no less than 4.5 hours without a proper public barrier in place and without a single identifiable
employee.
The inspector arrived at the licensee’s TRA site at approximately 4:20pm EST and identified a marine mammal exhibit set
up complete with two pools, a stage, a travel trailer containing the sea lions, a residential trailer and a small fence
bordering the exhibition area. The fence noticeably stopped at the edges of the travel trailer and did not form a barrier
barring entrance into the trailer containing the sea lions. The inspector observed a drink concessions trailer being dropped
off adjacent to sea lion exhibit. Three individuals working on this task identified themselves as employees of the
concession stand and mentioned that they had nothing to do with the licensee’s business. They were seen walking
unsupervised around the TRA site in order to maneuver their trailer. After calling the licensee and leaving a voicemail
requesting to conduct an inspection, the inspector knocked on the licensee’s residential trailer and loudly identified herself
as an USDA inspector. There was no response from either the residential trailer or the travel trailer holding the sea lions.
A quick inspection around the outside of the trailer and surrounding areas confirmed that none of the Sea Lion Splash
LLC employees or the licensee were on site. The licensee was called again at approximately 5:47pm EST and a
voicemail was left requesting a return phone call.
While waiting for an employee to return to the site, the inspector observed that the back of the trailer containing the sea
lions, their food and necessary water quality chemicals had no public barrier and was left completely open so that the
public could easily walk approach the trailer containing the 3 sea lions. The trailer door to the freezer storing fish was left
open, and the freezer door was not seen to have a locking mechanism. Furthermore, the trailer door to the transport
enclosure housing the three sea lions had been left completely open and any person could easily step into the trailer and
interact with the animals. The sea lions could be heard vocalizing/splashing around and observed from outside the trailer.
The door to their enclosure consisted of thin metal bars that could allow the smaller two sea lions to poke their heads
through. The width of spaces between the metal bars could allow any member of the public to touch and/or pass food
through to the animals. Furthermore, under the steps leading up to the sea lion enclosure, a large collection of cleaning
and water quality chemicals were being stored. These were within easy access to any passing individual.
Until the licensee’s employee finally arrived, the inspector observed various individuals entering the county fair property
through an unguarded gate directly across from the TRA set up. There was not a security guard posted at the gate
entrance, and the inspector did not observe any readily identifiable security officials patrolling throughout the county fair
property. Additionally, various employees from different exhibitors/concession stands/fair rides were seen driving golf
carts or walking around the TRA set up.
The complete lack of employee supervision over the animals and the lack of a physical barrier barring entrance to the
animals for a period of almost 4.5 hours severely compromised the safety of the animals. Any member of the public could
have entered the trailer and harmed the animals or have been harmed by the sea lions. Additionally, the chemicals were
openly available to be tampered with or used to harm the animals. The current public barrier does nothing to impede
access to the sea lions or their food whenever the employees are not directly supervising the animals. Additionally, the
licensee’s reliance on the fair ground’s security to supervise the animals is inadequate to provide protection to the animals
from abuse and harassment by the viewing public.
All marine mammals must be provided with protection from abuse and harassment by the viewing public by the use of a
sufficient number of uniformed or readily identifiable employees or attendants to supervise the viewing public, or by

unable to afford veterinary care and the licensee had agreed to take the cat back and provide veterinary treatment for the
abdominal mass (believed to be an abdominal hernia) and blood in the urine. When evaluated by APHIS officials, this
cat was found to be thin, with protruding hip bones and spine, and exhibited “skin tent” (delayed return to normal position
after the skin on the back of the neck was tented) which is consistent with moderate dehydration. There was an
approximately 6 cm soft mass at the lower abdomen towards the hind legs which is consistent with the history of a
reported hernia. Additionally, the cat favored the left front paw and was observed holding the paw up in the air when not
walking.

for consigned transport at approximately 6:50 PM ET on 30December2022 in Townsend, Delaware. The dog was
transported in a crate in the transporter’s minivan. The dog was delivered to the receiver in Jesup, Iowa on Iowa at
approximately midmorning on 05January2023. The consignor and receiver had been told by the transporter that the
transport would take approximately 2 days. The distance between the two locations is approximately 1040 miles, yet the
transport took 5 days. The consignor and the receiver became concerned about the length of time the transporter was
taking, as recorded in the detailed Field Service Report generated by the Captain of the Delaware Health and Social
Services (DHSS) Animal Welfare Division, dated 06April2023.
The dog was found cold, stiff, and clearly deceased when the transporter and receiver opened the crate together in the
transporter’s van in the midmorning of 05January2023. The transporter was unaware that the dog had died while in his
possession. This information was verified by the transporter and the Iowa receiver.
During a two-hour phone conversation held between the transporter, the Animal Care Transportation Specialist, and the
Inspector on 07June2023 at 1 pm ET, the transporter was asked if he had knowledge or records of when he fed and
watered the dog during the 5-day transport. The transporter stated that he had no records of when he fed and watered the
dog and provided no clear information on the type of food provided and at what frequency food and water were offered.
The transporter was also unable to provide a travel itinerary or when/where he stopped during the 5-day transport.
Although the transporter stated during the call that he did feed and water the dog (but provided no details or
documentation), the necropsy report dated 05January2023 states that the “patient is severely dehydrated, eye are sucken
in (sic), and has dark, tarlike stools. Can confirm that patient was not fed or watered during transport due to the severity of
malnourishment."" During a phone conversation on 15June2023 between the veterinarian who conducted the necropsy on
05January2023 and the Inspector, they stated that ""there was no ingesta in the stomach or small colon and only the dark
tarry material in the large colon. The dog had been dead for at least 12 hours prior to the necropsy, based on the level of
post-mortem changes.""
Based on the information provided by the veterinarian conducting the necropsy the same morning of the discovered death
of the dog, the transporter apparently did not feed the dog at least every 24 hours and water the dog at least every 12
hours, as required by the federal AWA. The transporter was unable to state or document when the dog was last fed or
watered. The failure to provide food and water at the required intervals directly contributed to the starvation and
dehydration death of this dog.

Failure to provide a sufficient amount of bedding/litter to absorb and cover excreta can lead to medical issues such as
skin irritation, stress, and discomfort to the animals. If a slatted or mesh floor is used in the enclosure, it must be designed
and constructed so that the animal cannot put any part of its body between the slats or through the holes in the mesh.
Unless the dogs and cats are on raised slatted floors or raised floors made of mesh, the primary enclosure must contain
enough previously unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The litter must be of a suitably absorbent material that is
safe and nontoxic to the dogs.",True

Failure to transport dogs in enclosures of sufficient size does not afford them the ability to make normal postural
movements or adjustments and may cause stress or discomfort. Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must be large
enough to ensure that each animal contained in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while
standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position.",True

""Bobby"", MC#992001001497979, a male golden retriever: In his enclosure, the slatted floor was tilted at an angle and an
unsecured plastic food receptacle was lodged between the slatted floor and the bottom of the enclosure.
""Yan Yi"", MC#900219001330203, an approximately 5 – 6-year-old male golden retriever: An unsecured pink plastic food
receptacle was severely chewed up and observed on the floor of his travel crate. In addition, the receptacle was not
securely attached to the travel enclosure, the construction of the container was not appropriate for the dog as it was
chewed up into small pieces which may have been ingested, possibly causing a bowel obstruction or other health hazard
to the dog.
To protect the health and well-being of the animals, food and water receptacles should be securely fastened to the inside
of the travel crates and be constructed of such materials appropriate for the animals they are intended for. Food and
water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled
from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Food and water containers must be designed, constructed, and
installed so that a dog or cat cannot leave the primary enclosure through the food or water opening.",True

""Buddy"", a male Malamute MC# 276099200058412 and MC#992001001497790: This dog was noted as disabled and
could not stand upright on his pelvic limbs. He had hind limb weakness bilaterally and had severely matted fur and fecal
and urine staining of lower half of body. The Los Angeles County Public Health veterinarian stated the dog was not fit for
travel via air cargo as Buddy cannot ambulate on his own.
""Yan Yi"", a male Golden Retriever MC#900219001330203: On physical exam, this dog had a 1-inch mass/callus which
was slightly ulcerated was found on the left front paw and a small 1 cm blister/mass on the chest with hair loss and
redness. The veterinarian stated that masses should be checked for malignancy and monitored for infection if they
rupture.
""Scarlet"", a female Golden Retriever MC#900239877803815: On physical exam, Scarlet smelled of urine and there was
evidence of redness and irritation of the skin on her ventral chest area.
Tin tin, a male Golden Retriever MC#276099200573130: on physical exam this dog had an area of skin thickening, that is
usually a result of constant scratching or rubbing, on the inside of his right thigh. He also had hair loss on both right and
left sides of his perianal area.
Aurora, a female spayed Golden Retriever MC#900219001383987, on physical exam had irritation of the skin and was
scratching. She had hair loss on the outside of her right knee. Large, scabby lesions were seen along her back and right
hip. She had hyperpigmented areas along her abdomen and both ears had a moderate amount of reddish-brown
discharge.
It is the responsibility of the transporter to ensure there are no dogs obviously ill, injured, or in physical distress. A system
should be in place to ensure the regulations under section 3.18, Care in Transit, have been followed, for the health and
well-being of the dogs.

38740,30e629bdf9b116b0,2.25(a),,False,Requirements and procedures.,"During an inspection at RDU airport, the inspector learned that animals moving from above-wing to below-wing for two
airlines were being handled by an intermediate group, Superior. Subsequent conversations with Superior personnel
revealed that they are not currently registered as a handler with USDA Animal Care. The employee stated that Superior
will immediately apply for a registration. Handling animals in an airport moving from above-wing to below-wing without the
required regulatory oversight can lead to unregulated handling of animals, putting the animals at risk of unnecessary
behavioral stress, trauma, escape, physical harm, or loss of life. The regulations require that each carrier and
intermediate handler register with the Secretary by completing and filing a properly executed form which will be furnished,
upon request, by the Deputy Administrator.
Conducting regulated activity without a valid registration violates the Federal Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activity can be conducted until a valid registration certificate is issued by USDA Animal Care.
