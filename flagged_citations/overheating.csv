• Based on available clinical and research records, a macaque was recorded as being hypothermic throughout a four-hour
anesthesia (93.3 – 93.7 degrees F) and vomited during recovery in January 2021. The research team did not contact the
AV team to report timely and accurate information about the macaque’s condition. The following morning during routine
daily observations, the AV team found the macaque unresponsive in its enclosure. It was noted that the anesthesia and
recovery records were incomplete, and that vomiting had not been recorded in the records. Despite immediate response
by the AV team upon notification, the macaque’s condition continued to deteriorate, and it was subsequently euthanized.
The necropsy documented bronchopneumonia. Due to the lack of communication from the research team, the AV team
was not afforded the opportunity to assess the animal’s condition in a timely manner.
• Five incidences of cats not recovering as anticipated from neuroscience research procedures over the past year were
documented by an IACUC investigation. In each instance, the researcher indicated that the cats were QAR (quiet, alert
and responsive) when returned to their housing enclosure following procedures performed under anesthesia as described
in the IACUC-approved protocol. The researcher did not recognize any abnormal findings and did not communicate any
concerns to the AV team. Yet the AV team determined during same-day evaluations shortly thereafter that the cats were
in fact painful, hypothermic, hyperthermic, in shock, and/or in distress and required immediate medical intervention by the
AV team.
• Five rabbits that had undergone prior IACUC-approved surgical procedures did not receive protocol-directed gabapentin
on a Sunday in May 2021. The research person responsible for administering the medication ran out of sufficient
medication but did not contact the AV team for guidance. The research team contacted the AV team on Monday morning
upon noting the lack of Sunday medication administration. Upon notification, the AV team promptly evaluated the
impacted animals and reported that no ill effects were noted due to this missed medication administration. The AV team
provided gabapentin to the research team and it was subsequently administered per protocol. The AV team was not
afforded the opportunity to evaluate the animals in a timely manner.
Failure of research staff to make and communicate daily observations to the AV team in a timely manner can have direct
and significant impacts on the health and wellbeing of research animals. Per the regulations, each research facility shall

except that provided by the three-sided, unventilated run-in shed and an ineffective shade cloth structure. The shade
factor of the shade cloth over the hay area was low and allowed excessive amounts of sun to penetrate, resulting in
inadequate shade. Upon re-evaluation of the amount of shade in the enclosure at approximately 12 pm, adequate shade
again could not be confirmed. The sheep were noted to be closely lined up along the narrow strip of shade available
provided by the outside overhang of the roof of the run-in shed. Several were standing in direct sunlight due to
inadequate shaded space availability. Temperatures for that day were recorded at 95 degrees F with high humidity.
Inadequate shade provision during periods of direct sunlight, high heat and humidity can cause significant stress and
discomfort to the animals. Upon discussion of the inspectors’ inadequate shade observations with the AV during the
inspection, the AV team immediately evaluated the animals and determined that they were exhibiting no signs of heat
exhaustion. The AV team also evaluated the enclosure and acknowledged the lack of adequate shade. Fans were
promptly added inside the run-in sheds in use at the time of inspection. Per subsequent communication with the AV, upon
fan installation, the interior shed temperatures decreased by 15-20 degrees and the sheep were reported to go inside the

study protocol, and subsequent failure to identify a malfunctioning heating pad that may have contributed to the
unexpected death of a rabbit undergoing a non-survival surgical procedure. According to anesthesia records, there
was a period of approximately 4 hours in which no temperature was recorded while the animal was under
anesthesia for this procedure. This is contrary to the approved protocol which states that a rectal temperature will be
monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. Written records indicate that the animal died while under anesthesia and
it is recorded that the animal’s blood pressure dropped due to hypothermia and hemodilution. It was also noted in
the records that the water-heated mat under the animal had turned off, leading to hypothermia.The veterinary staff
was not immediately notified of intraoperative problems or of the animal’s death. A necropsy was not performed on
the rabbit. By monitoring the temperature at more frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and
addressed sooner. The facility identified that proper steps to ensure the health and welfare of the animal may not
have been taken because records to substantiate those efforts were inadequately maintained. The facility must

cynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during transport to necropsy after the conclusion of a MRI and PET scan
procedure. The IACUC self-identified that there was non-compliance with the facility’s IACUC policies and a failure
to follow the protocol. The animal was under anesthesia during the procedure and there were gaps in physiological
monitoring (i.e. Sp02, PR, RR, EtCO2, body temperature and BP) based on the records, which should have
occurred every 15 minutes. For example, there were no entries on anesthetic monitoring recorded between 3:47 am
and 4:26 am (39 minutes); there were no entries for temperature or EtCO2 from 3:47 am to 8:20 am (4 hours, 33
minutes); and there was a lack of physiologic monitoring recorded between 7:00 am to 8:20 am (80 minutes). Also,
the animal experienced ongoing complications such as hypothermia, hypotension, wet lung sounds and fluid in the
endotracheal tube during the anesthetic procedure. The first documented rectal temperature near the start of the
procedure at 3:47 am was recorded as 95.7 degrees F. Although a Bair Hugger had been placed on the animal
around 4:25am, the next recorded temperature continued to be decreased at 94.8 degrees F at 8:20 am. Although
the animal’s temperature began to slowly increase after this time, the animal’s recorded SpO2 dropped to 85% at
9:25 am (ranging 81%-91% from 9:25 am to 11:05 am) while previously being recorded mostly in the mid to upper
90’s. Wet lung sounds and removal of some fluid from the endotracheal tube were first documented by the
laboratory veterinary technician at 8:00 am. A veterinarian was contacted by phone by the PI approximately 6 hours
into the approximately 8 hour procedure, at which time the veterinarian’s suggestions were followed. Although
interventional steps were taken, including assistance from the Division of Comparative Medicine's (DCM) veterinary
technicians, and the laboratory staff felt the animal was stable, the animal’s Sp02 values continued to be low and
the animal died before the planned euthanasia. The IACUC also determined that the on-call veterinary staff should
have been contacted prior to when a veterinarian had been called given the ongoing complications noted
throughout the procedure.
By monitoring and recording physiologic parameters during anesthetic procedures at regular intervals, and as
according to the protocol and facility’s policies, changes in those parameters may be identified and addressed
sooner. This can decrease possible negative effects on the health and well-being of the animal.

skunk continued to shiver for at least 3 minutes. The skunk’s enclosure had a shelter box but the door had been blocked,
restricting the skunk’s access to use the shelter. The rest of the enclosure consists of a wire floor and wire hooped walls &
roof, with no other wind or rain break. This same type of enclosure and method of restricting access to the shelter boxes
was observed for 11 of the 83 total red fox and 3 of the 29 total arctic fox as well as the 3 striped skunk. Most of these
enclosures had either nothing acting as additional wind or rain break, or a small section of shingle-like paper material

by the license prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the
attending veterinarian.
- One white colored red fox was identified as being in very poor body condition. This fox co-housed with another white
colored red fox in an enclosure with two green cards with the number “8” on them. The hips, pelvis, ribs and shoulder for
this fox were easily visible. It had poor hair coat and a pronounced abdominal tuck. There was no food or water was
present in the enclosure when first identified by inspectors. When water was provided both fox in the enclosure drank, the
severely underweight fox drank for a prolonged time (approximately 3 minutes) stopping only briefly when interrupted or
when it went to look in the food bowl. When asked the licensee stated that this was “old”, approximately 10 years old, and
that some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot. He agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that
or his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection. Poor body condition can indicate a
lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Particularly when combined
with increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the
attending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be
prescribed. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can
lead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death.
- One adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the
majority of its body. There were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the
animal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds. The hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck
area. The licensee stated that he hadn’t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to
fleas. He agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal.
- One Skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown
toenails. The nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal
positions. This skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk. When observed trying to groom its face, the
animal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable. Excessively long nails can cause
abnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals. Prolonged
severely overgrown nails can lead to chronic musculoskeletal abnormalities and may be painful. In addition to this skunk,
at least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their
health and comfort.
- One adult skunk present in enclosure R2C1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface
of the right eye. Additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye. The licensee stated
that he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract. There was no discharge,
however, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts). Ocular
conditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious,
traumatic, or inherited.
- Five of the Six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. The two black and one white alpaca had long
matted cords of fiber dangling from their body past their knees. The others had more tightly matted fiber over their trunk
and back. The amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. That alpaca was
excessively thin with a very prominent spine. Body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount
of fiber present. The licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall. Excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to
discomfort and overheating in the hot summer months. Additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to
keep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.
- One brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip. This
animal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca’s weight / body condition. Proper
occlusion of incisors is necessary for grazing.
- One juvenile fallow deer had approximately 10-12 black raised roughly circular rough dark colored wart-like growths on
both sides of its face. These ranged from approximately ½ to 2 cm and were primarily around the eyes and mouth. When
pointed out to the licensee, he stated he thought they were just flies. Skin growths can be caused by a variety of agents
including several which may be contagious to other animals (such as when caused by viruses).
- One standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) had hair loss on its rump and entire tail. The
hair that was present was short appearing nearly even with the skin. The licensee stated that this animal was “molting”
and “sometimes they do that”, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. Hair with this type of extremely
short appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted such as self-
barbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes. Communication with
the attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause
and prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.
- One grey colored Mink had hair loss on the tip of its tail. And area approximately 1 cm long was nearly hairless. The
licensee stated that he had not observed the hair loss in his animal, but that sometimes Mink pull or chew their fur out.
Hair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. When self-
induced, hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological dysfunction, or other problems.

- One individually housed Striped skunk was observed having a large amount of saliva present its face. There was saliva
extending from the left side of the mouth up its face surrounding its left eye and up to its ear and slightly beyond as well
as under its chin down its chest and over the front legs. The fur surrounding the left eye, cheek, and chin were wet to the
skin with saliva. The licensee removed the skunk from the enclosure upon further inspection the skunk appeared to have
swelling in its mouth. The skunk was slow and appeared slightly sluggish. Increased salivation and swelling may indicate
dental pain, oral ulcerations, or oral wounds which can cause the animal to be reluctant to eat. Excessive salivation may
also be signs of other diseases is skunk. The licensee stated that he had not noticed this prior to the inspection.
- One Striped skunk housed on the left side of the mink barn was observed not being able to open its left eye. The left eye
of the animal had swelling above the eyelid and the eye was completely sealed shut. Ocular conditions combined with
swelling and discharge are often painful and can be indicative of eye infections or other injury or illness.
- One Arctic fox singly housed in an enclosure without shelter, was found to be excessively thin. The hips, pelvis, and ribs
were more readily apparent than they should be with the amount of fur present. Poor body condition can result from
illness, inadequate feed, or other causes and requires appropriate examination determine the cause and determine the
proper treatment.
- Four of the six alpaca continue to have an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. The two black and one white alpaca
had long matted cords of fiver dangling from their body past their knees. The other had more tightly matted fiber. The
amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. That alpaca was excessively

- One standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) continues to have hair loss on its rump and
entire tail. The hair that was present was slightly longer than on prior inspection, but still appeared short. The licensee
continued to state that this animal was “molting”, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. Hair with this
type of extremely short appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted

Communication with the attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the
underlying cause and prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.
- At least five adult Striped skunks were observed with extremely overgrown toenails. In each instance the nails were long
enough that they were curling and/or bending over one another. In some cases, they were pushing the toes into abnormal
positions. Excessively long toenails can cause abnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures
disrupting freedom of movement. In addition to these skunk other animals (Arctic fox, Red fox, and less severely impacted
skunk) also had overgrown toenails that needed trimmed for their health and comfort.
- The adult male striped skunk that with excessively long nails noted on the prior inspection continued to have an
abnormal gait despite that the nails had been trimmed by the licensee. The licensee removed this skunk from the
enclosure so that inspectors could observe it more closely. The left hind foot had an area with tan flaky crusty areas that
appeared to be scabs and likely were contributing to the abnormal gait. Foot wounds can result from walking on wire,
particularly wire that is poorly coated and or has sharp points and may be painful.
- One White-nosed coati was observed with hair loss on the tip of the tail. The tip of the tail had an approximately 2-inch
area that had extremely short hair. The next approximately 6-inches from the tip of the tail the hair was noticeably thinner
than the rest of the tail. The licensee stated that the tail was shorter than normal due to the animal being in conditions that
were too cold for the animal prior to when he acquired it. The licensee did not state whether he had observed the hair loss
prior to inspection, however, he stated that occasionally the coati will chew on their tails. He also acknowledged that he
could appreciate the hair loss when pointed out. Hair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as
nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. When self-induced hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological
dysfunction, or other problems. This condition requires examination to determine the appropriate treatment.

large tree limbs have fallen onto enclosures due to the intense gusts of wind. These animals do not have adequate
protection from inclement weather. Nor do they have visual barriers to avoid perceived threats, such as other fox housed
in close proximity. Numerous Arctic fox were observed frozen in position, growling and/or attempting to climb the walls of
the enclosure to escape, as inspectors approached. This demonstrates their instinctual need to hide in the face of
perceived danger. Adequate shelter from the elements (such as a hide box) allows animals to make normal behavioral
adjustments for the species. Lacking this shelter leads to extreme stress and possible exposure injury, especially as

structures for shelter. This animal is currently in poor body condition with ribs and vertebrae visible. There is a small
amount of bedding in each structure that is excessively wet and soiled. One shelter also contains a small amount of meat
that the licensee stated was left over from the prior feeding. The licensee states that he does not remove food, but rather
leaves it until the animals eat it. The cougar was laying in one shelter when inspectors approached the enclosure, but got
up and exited upon our approach. The animal had areas of soiled wet fur on its hind end from where it was laying.
Additionally, the remainder of enclosure was covered in snow. The cougar walked abnormally shaking each foot
intermittently clearly reluctant to walk in the snow and showing signs of discomfort. There is currently no clean, dry place
for the cougar to walk or lay anywhere within it’s enclosure or the shelters provided.
The 2 female brown bears and 1 male brown bear are co-housed in a single primary enclosure with three individual metal
barrels provided for the bears to use as shelters. The male and female black bears are currently co-housed in the same
primary enclosure with 2 metal barrels provided for the bears to use as shelter. The two juvenile brown bears have two
shelters provided – one metal barrel and one square plastic tank type shelter. The smaller juvenile brown bear has a
rough coat and is thin.
At the time of the last inspection the licensee implemented temporary measures to alleviate the suffering of the bears by
wrapping the barrels with blankets for insulation and adding fresh bedding to the barrels provided for shelter from the
elements. Due to recent snow the blankets have become wet and the bedding is now wet and soiled. There is snow
present in most of the barrels present for shelter. The majority of the hay/straw that had been added for bedding is now
strewn across the enclosures. What remains in the barrels is discolored and appears wet. The barrel which the adult
male black bear is currently housed in has no bedding in much of the barrel and there is a several inch hole now visible in
the bottom of the barrel. The licensee said that he has been there to care for the bears in the last 2 weeks but declined to
speculate when. He refused to answer whether he had cleaned or replaced bedding at any time since the last inspection
instead asking if there was a regulation for that.
The local ambient temperature was 2 degrees F at 9AM, 7 degrees at 10:45 AM (when the inspection began), and
approximately 17 degrees F when the inspection concluded. Surface temperatures were taken for each of the metal
barrels in several locations using a RayTek IR Thermometer. The inside of the majority of the barrels were 18-24 degrees
F. The warmest measurements were in the 31-34 degrees F for a barrel which was in direct sun. The combination of
wet/soiled bedding and wet snow-covered blankets prevents them from providing appropriate insulation and therefore
they are no longer adequate.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall
be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
The prior attempts to correct this noncompliance were temporary and have not been maintained. Correct by ensuring that

has had fresh bedding placed on top of the old wet soiled bedding. The other shelter contains only the old soiled and wet
bedding. The remainder of enclosure was covered in snow which in some places was several inches deep. The one
shelter is the only clean, dry place for the cougar to walk or lay anywhere within its enclosure or the shelters provided.
The temperature in this enclosure was 26.5 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit. The shelter with the soiled bedding was 21.5

The licensee has now brushed the snow off the metal barrels and has added tarps over the blankets which were wrapped
over the barrels for insulation. This temporary fix is not appropriate for local climatic conditions. Poor weather will once
again quickly deteriorate this temporary fix. Shelters for the enclosures housing the black bears have had bedding placed
on top of the old wet soiled bedding. This is also the case for the three shelters provided for the three adult brown bears.
No fresh bedding has been provided for the shelters housing the juvenile brown bears. The snow that was present in the
black and brown bear enclosures yesterday is still easily visible mixed with the fresh bedding that has been added.
When asked if the soiled bedding had been removed the licensee stated to inspectors that this could not be done in the
few hours he had before our afternoon inspection. The licensee stated that removing the soiled bedding would require
the use of a bobcat machine and that was not even at the property currently. The new bedding placed in some of the
animal shelters will quickly become soiled by the old bedding and snow already in the shelters and the wet, wintery
weather conditions that are forecast to continue.
The local ambient temperature was 26 degrees Fahrenheit at 3:30 pm which is about the time the inspection began.
Surface temperatures were taken for each of the metal barrels in several locations using a RayTek IR Thermometer. The
inside temperatures of the barrels ranged from 21 to 37 degrees Fahrenheit with most of the barrels being in the upper
twenties to lower thirties. The expected overnight low for tonight is 12 degrees Fahrenheit and the expected low
temperature for tomorrow is 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
Failing to provide appropriate shelter from the elements particularly in the extreme cold weather currently occurring and
failing to remove soiled bedding is causing a state of unrelieved suffering for these animals.

as the “Front Addax Pen,” the “Back Addax Pen”, the “Oryx Pen,” the “Ibex Pen,” and the “Hog Deer Enclosure.” In
addition, the front addax pen contains at least 3-4 pregnant females (at least one of which is thin); this will add to the
numbers of animals present without shelter, including neonates which will not be able to withstand the colder weather.
The “back addax pen” and “oryx pen” include animals that cannot adequately thermoregulate due to poor body condition.
Based on weather temperatures predicted by the National Weather Forecast
(https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/tx/odessa/79763), evening temperatures will be in the range of 30-45F in the
coming days, along with wind gusts. It is not recommended to house healthy adult addax and oryx at temperatures
below 45F and above 100F without the ability to compensate; these temperatures would be considered more severe and
adversive for neonatal/juvenile animals, as well as those in poor body condition and poor hair coat. Similar concerns
regarding cold temperatures and lack of adequate shelters apply to other tropical to semi-tropical species housed at the

death from exposure to the elements. When climatic conditions present a threat to animal health or well-being,
appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to

There were at least 8 enclosures housing 10 dogs in outdoor enclosures without adequate bedding. According to
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the outdoor air temperature for the past 36 hours, in the
area was 6 degrees F for a low and wind chill was -9 degrees F with a temperature of 19 degrees F at the time of

indivually. Some of the shelters had most of the floor exposed while others had a thin layer of bedding that was
fairly evenly distributed on the floor with parts of the floor easily seen. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing
a sufficient source to keep them warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. The

veterinarian (AV).
**DIRECT--A male tiger named Rajah had been noted to have a quarter-sized mass on the left side of the tail during
the inspection conducted on 28 May 2014 which was to be examined by a veterinarian by 4 June 2014. The AV did
a visual evaluation on 3 June 2014 and determined that anesthesia would be required to fully examine this lesion
and that it would need to be done when the temperatures were not too warm to avoid overheating of the animal
during the procedure. No examination by the AV had been performed at the time of this inspection (7 months since
first noted) and the mass is now significantly larger with a reddened center. Masses and growing lesions may be
due to infection, cancer, or other serious veterinary conditions. This animal needs to be examined by the AV as
soon as possible with appropriate diagnostic testing to determine if the mass needs to be surgically removed or if
other treatment is needed to prevent the condition from worsening. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic
testing performed, treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be made and be
available for review by APHIS inspectors.
**DIRECT--A male white tiger named O-jaus housed with 2 female white tigers, Samundra and Subadra, was noted
during this inspection to be in thin body condition and had a very unusual posture and gait. His backbone area
appeared hunched with the vertebral processes appearing more prominent. His hind feet appear pigeon-toed as he
walks, that he is carefully placing the hind feet, and his hips sway noticeably. The care takers present during this
part of the inspection were not aware if this was a recent development and no documentation of weight loss or
abnormal gait had been made at the time of this inspection by the animal care staff or by the AV. Weight loss and
abnormal gait are indicators of an underlying veterinary condition (nutritional, arthritis, injury, etc) and this animal
needs to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and
plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.
**DIRECT--A juvenile male red kangaroo, Rascal, was noted to have numerous circular lesions on his tail by one of
the care staff accompanying the inspection. Upon close examination, there were at least a dozen areas varying
from pea to quarter- size where the skin was reddened and the hair was missing in a circular pattern. The AV had
not been notified of this condition which may be ringworm, a fungal infection contagious to animals and people
(zoonosis), or some other skin or hair condition. Documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including
any diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs
to be made and available for review by APHIS inspectors.
**DIRECT--The male leopard, Bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on
his tail. One of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail
sometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. The current areas had not been documented by care staff
nor reported to the AV for evaluation. This animal needs to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible
diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.
- Two adult male leopards, Bagheera and Jabaree, were noted to have unusual pigmentation of their left eyes.
Bagheera had a block of brown-copper color on the pigmented portion of the eye and Jabaree(cid:25)'s entire left eye
appeared to be reddish-brown in color. The licensee stated that the leopards(cid:25) have had this condition since they
were cubs but the APHIS inspectors have never been able to observe these animals during inspection as they
always hide in their enclosures or den boxes when the licensee is accompanying the inspection. The licensee was
not present during this portion of the inspection and the leopards both came up to the enclosure fencing and
allowed a thorough examination. This is not a normal presentation for the eyes of leopards and there is no
documentation or information indicating what is causing the condition, how long it has been present, or whether
there is any need for monitoring and treatment of the eye condition by the AV. Changes in the coloration of the eye
may be a genetic condition or could indicate an underlying problem such as infection and needs to be evaluated by
the AV.
- A male serval named Limpopo was pacing the front of his enclosure during this inspection and was noted to have
several rough areas in his hair coat on his back. This may be matted hair which can be due to lack of grooming or
underlying injury or infection and should be evaluated by the AV.
- Three ring tailed lemurs, Bongo, Talisa, and Taz, were noted to have significant thinning and hair loss on their tails
that had not been documented by the care staff nor evaluated by the AV. Thinning hair and loss of hair may be a
sign of overgrooming by conspecifics or by the individual animal due to stress or dominance issues, underlying
veterinary condition (endocrine, infection, allergies), or due to trauma to the hair follicles and needs to be evaluated
by the AV. Documentation of examination of these animals(cid:25)' tails, including any diagnostic testing, monitoring and
treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition needs to be made and available for review by
APHIS inspectors.
--A ring tailed lemur named Abu was noted to be obese and had prominent raised areas on both hip areas. The
care staff accompanying this portion of the inspection had not noted this condition and no documentation of this was
available for APHIS at the time of the inspection. The licensee stated during the exit briefing that these were saddle
bags(cid:29) but the AV had not examined this animal to determine what was causing the raised areas or lumps on Abu'(cid:25)s
hips which may be excess fat or may be a due to a veterinary condition .
- A hedgehog named Cow was noted to be awake and actively running around his enclosure in the Welcome Center
during daylight hours (nocturnal animal typically). Both of his eyes appeared to have white centers which may
indicate cataracts or another veterinary condition that may affect his vision. This condition had not been noted by
any of the care staff nor had the AV been notified at the time of this inspection.
- The carnivores (tigers, lions, bears, caracal, serval, savannah cat, leopards, bobcat, cougar) are not being fed a
commercially prepared diet that is nutritionally complete. No diet plan is documented nor approved by the AV for
these animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological
needs. Numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body
condition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than
adults to meet their growth needs. One of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was
questioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of
the vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.
For example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the
care staff. The recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a
meat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to
meet these animals daily requirement of calcium. Additionally, the licensee hand-raises tiger cubs and does not
have a documented diet plan to ensure these cubs receive the appropriate nutrition to ensure their healthy growth to
adulthood.
Animals that are not being fed a commercially prepared, nutritionally complete diet appropriate for the species and
to ensure their health and well-being need to have a diet plan documented and approved by the AV that is
maintained, followed, updated as necessary for new animals or changes in their age or physiologic needs, and able
to be reviewed by APHIS inspectors.
The facility must have an established program of veterinary care which ensures problems are identified and
communicated to the AV and that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat veterinary conditions
are used.
The following animals need to examined by the AV by 14 Jan 2015:
Tiger Rajah, Tiger Ojaus, Kangaroo Rascal, Leopard Bagheera

12/18 a note states that the barn heat is “not so great” and that they are “working on different ideas” because the heat is
“sitting in the viewing area”. At the time of inspection the temperature in the barn was 58.4 degrees F at midday, on a day
with recorded low and high temperatures of 41 and 64 degrees F.
Giraffes are quite susceptible to cold, and especially when confronted with other health challenges it is essential that
adequate heating is provided in colder climates in order to protect their well-being. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate
to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them

a transportation van for a procedure. Both animals were enrolled in an approved IACUC protocol, and the practice of
transporting two animals to imaging followed the facility procedures that had been in place for an extended period of time.
Upon arrival at the facility, the staff left the heater on, as the external temperature was approximately 61 degrees F and
took one monkey inside, while a geriatric female rhesus macaque was left in the van. During the anesthetized procedure,
the first monkey had complications and the staff left the van unattended for longer than usual. The animal in the van was
checked multiple times and on the second check, was found unresponsive and appropriate veterinary care was
immediately initiated. Despite immediate cooling and resuscitative procedures, the temperature initially was consistent
with hyperthermia and was stabilized to below normal within 90 minutes, but the animal never regained consciousness
and was humanely euthanized. The heater in the van is not thermostatically controlled and the temperature rose over the
course of the extended study in the first animal, resulting in hyperthermia in the monkey remaining in the van. The
necropsy indicated significant comorbidities in the animal, but confirmed that the cause of death was likely heat related.
The facility temporarily stopped transporting animals offsite and immediately stopped the practice of transporting two
animals at a time. The particular van was taken out of use in order to measure the temperatures in similar conditions and
heat was documented rapidly developing within the van, which likely exposed the animal to temperatures in excess of the
regulatory standard of 85 degrees F for greater than 45 minutes. Temperature monitoring was initiated in the cargo area
and thermostatically controlled heaters and air conditioning units are to be utilized in the future.

have been hiding in a den box. The den boxes are not heated. Coatimundi are native to warm climates, such as
central and South America. At the time of inspection, it was a cold, damp, windy overcast day. Winter
temperatures for the area easily fall well below freezing. Animals experience undue stress and may develop health
complications when their provided environment is not consistent with their evolutionary development. Natural or
artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all

In the outdoor enclosure housing the large breed dogs there were 2 female dogs with litters. The Golden Retriever
had a litter of five 4.5 week old puppies and the Poodle had a litter of seven 5 week old puppies. Three puppies (2
from the litter of 5 and 1 from the litter of 7) were observed to be shivering and seeking areas of warmth. In the
enclosure of 5 puppies, there was a heating pad that was plugged in. It was placed on the dirt ground on one side of
the enclosure but it was partially covered with dirt. The litter of 5 puppies were not provided with adequate shelter or
bedding. The litter of 7 did have a shelter but there was no bedding or a wind break or rain break. The temperature

licensee said early that morning up to 6"" of heavy slush/snow had fallen and covered the entire enclosure and pond,
making it difficult to distinguish the pond's borders in the landscape. The licensee reported all four cubs and tiger mother
were observed to be fine early that morning, but shortly after observed abnormal behavior from the mother and he went
over to the den and found a dead cub, possibly moved there by the mother. Once the mother tiger was secured, he went
down to the pond and removed a cub from the water, but it was also deceased. He said he called the AV and that over
the phone the AV presumably thought hypothermic shock that led to drowning was the cause of death. The climatic
conditions that morning were likely a role in the tiger cubs' death. If climatic conditions create a threat to an animal's well-
being, appropriate action must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions, such as preventing access to water
features that can become unsafe in winter.

was a male Yorkie (#315) blk/bro that was drooling excessively on the left side of his mouth that had molars that
were encased in hard brown material. Inside the mouth the gums were red and swollen with what appeared to be
pus-like material around the remaining teeth in the back, and a very foul odor coming from the mouth. In addition, 6
other dogs of the 12 examined were in serious need of dental care; a Red Poodle F (#289), M (#267), Blk/wht
Poodle F (#273), wht/bro Poodle M (#269), Yorkie bro/blk M (#344) and white Poodle F (#330). All 6 reported dogs
have varying numbers of molars encased in a hard brown material with very red and inflamed gums with pus-like
material between the gum line and teeth. The male Poodle (#269) had both sides with all of the back teeth encased
in a solid row of a hard brown material making it impossible to discern individual teeth.
All of these dogs' had been recently purchased within the past 1.5 months by this licensee, and the veterinarian has
not been contacted to begin a dental program or begin treating the dogs' with bad teeth.
It is imperative that there is communication with the attending veterinarian to treat and maintain healthy teeth and
mouths of the regulated animals'. Bad teeth and gums can cause pain and discomfort to the animals as well as lead
to other health issues if left untreated.
INDIRECT: There were 5 dogs' that had numerous matts on their faces covering their eyes and some with matts on

matts covering her eyes, Poodle bro/wht M (#269) with facial and body matts, white Poodle F (#330) with matts
covering the eyes, and a black Poodle M (#232) with matts covering his eyes.
Matted hair needs to be removed in order to prevent any pain or discomfort from the matted hair pulling at the
animals' skin. The matted hair covering the eyes can cause eye irritation issues and hide infections that can occur
which can cause a serious health issue if left un-noticed and untreated. The eyes being covered by long hair and
matts can also prevent the animal from being able to see properly and cause stress and/or discomfort.
The licensee must consult the veterinarian to diagnose and treat regulated animals with teeth issues. Once the dogs
are identified that need dental care, the licensee must show an effort to get the animals treated in a timely manner
and continue working on getting the animals with bad teeth treated as needed.
All hair coats should be trimmed and maintained in order to prevent matt development. All matts should be removed
to prevent any pain or discomfort to the animal from hair pulling on the skin, and to prevent any sores or infections
that can occur to the eyes or body when covered by matted hair. The matted covered eyes should be trimmed to

1) The otters have recently stopped eating this old fish and given a diet of chicken and pork. These river otters are
known to eat mainly fish in the wild and some crustaceans, mollusks, insects, birds, oysters, shellfish, crabs,
crayfish, frogs, rodents, turtles and aquatic invertebrate and now given chicken and pork. The change in the otters
diet shall be prepared with consideration for the species and approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure its an
adequate diet. The mullet in an uncovered box had dry outside surfaces, cloudy eyes, soft when touch and foul
odor. It was stated that the fish were in the freezer one week, however the condition of the mullet appears this fish
had been thawed more than the two days in insufficient temperatures of 32 F to 45 F, that was recorded during this
inspection. Fish should be fed to these otters after being thawed 24 hours or discarded.
2) The ground beef was thawed, brown in color, and I was able to push my fingers from the plastic wrapping. This
ground beef has been stored at insufficient temperatures for at least several days or more and appears obtained
prior to the other meats.
3) The outsides of the pork and some of the chicken that is fed to the large felids and raccoons were thawed and
according to the curator was just obtained several days ago. The curator stated that the walk in freezer would be
repaired the day after this inspection which would be at least 3 days with possible insufficient refrigeration. Any
meats that are spoiled should not be use and once thawed shall not be frozen again.
Proper temperatures in refrigerated and freezer spaces should be—
Freezer: –22 to 0 F) Refrigerator: 40 to 43 F.
4) The tigers and lions are currently eating chicken and pork with a supplement, but no longer given beef which
was a part of their diet approved by the attending veterinarian. All diets need to be followed and the diet for the
overweight male adult white tiger needs to be reviewed by the attending veterinarian to ensure that its a complete
nutritional diet.
5) This facility is in the process of breeding their large felids, however there is no diet available if cubs would be
unable to feed from their mother. Often there are issues with the mother feeding her cubs, so there must be a
written alternative diet available.
All animals at this facility must be given a complete adequate diet approved by the attending veterinarian and or

various stages of heat distress. Some of the animals were exhibiting symptoms of severe heat stress including open

a person in Mississippi on 1/27/18. On 1/28/18, around 6:28pm, after being at a rest stop for approximately 45
minutes, the registrants observed the puppy in obvious physical distress (his “tummy seemed stiff”, his gums were
pale and he refused to take water, according to the registrants records). They stated they had left the air
conditioning on and had the windows open while at the rest stop. The registrants were just north of Lake City, FL at
that time, and they began trying to find an emergency veterinary clinic that was open on a Sunday night. The
nearest emergency clinic was about 65 miles (45 minutes, according to the registrant) away. Instead of heading
directly to the clinic, they tried to give various treatments (wetting the puppy down, offering water, administering
lemon juice and attempting to give Benadryl, Gatorade and Pedialyte) and stopped to check the puppy every 10 to
15 minutes. The puppy was found to be unresponsive and died at approximately 8:56pm on 1/28/18. It was
approximately 2 hours from the time they found the puppy in distress to the time that it died. As soon as an animal is
in obvious physical distress, veterinary care must be obtained at the closest available veterinary facility.
The puppy was taken to a vet for necropsy the following day. The necropsy revealed heat stroke as the likely cause
of the death. Young canines do not have body temperature control completely developed and some breeds, like this
puppy (a brachiocephalic breed), are already more susceptible to temperature changes and require more frequent

**Overnight, two male giraffes were shut in a heated giraffe shelter with the heater operating. The shelter is approximately
24 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a dirt floor with heavy bedding, and one large door. According to facility staff, the
giraffe shelter usually has 2 wall-mounted propane heaters but one was out for repairs, so there was only 1 heater which
was the only source of heat for the shelter. Facility staff did not have a method of monitoring the temperature overnight.
Facility staff had let the giraffes out of their shelter prior to 10AM. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe
shed was 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and the two male giraffes were walking around on the pasture in the safari park. The
two giraffes and numerous other safari park animals had access to the heated shelter, and according to facility staff the
shelter’s doors were left open all day. Inside the heated shelter, with the doors open and the single heater running, the
ambient temperature was 53 degrees Fahrenheit measured inside the barn, 5 feet off the ground, approximately 12 feet
from the front of the heater which was on (this is the location where the facility employee usually measures the
temperature using an IR gun pointed at the floor). The giraffes did not use the heated shelter while inspectors were
present but a camel did enter the structure. Facility staff stated that while other animals including buffalo use the heated
shelter throughout the day, it does not appear to prevent the giraffes from using the shelter and multiple species have

**Overnight, one adult female giraffe and one 7-month-old female giraffe calf were housed in a 60 foot by 80 foot heated
giraffe barn with 1 parrot and 3 caracal cats. The giraffe barn contains 3 stalls, each with their own narrow roll-up door to
the outside. The giraffes were located in the middle stall. The roll up giraffe doors are located on the north side of the
barn, and within the barn the giraffe stalls take up the north half of the barn. The heaters are mounted on the south wall of
the barn. Facility staff reported that the calf had been nervous to enter the barn in the past but had begun entering the
barn more often recently; staff also reported that the calf appeared to be nervous when the barn doors were shut with her
inside, so the roll-up door to the central stall was left about 2/3 raised (open) all night. An enclosure housing 3 caracal
cats is located approximately 6 feet in front of the central giraffe stall with no visual barriers between the giraffes and the
cats.
The female giraffes had access to the outdoors and to central stall overnight and throughout the day. The other doors to
the barn were kept closed and the wall-mounted propane heaters were left running all night (the only heat source in the
barn). Facility staff did not have any means of measuring the temperature in the barn overnight, and they had not yet
taken the temperature in the barn that morning. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe barn was 42
degrees Fahrenheit. The female giraffes were observed to be inside the center stall in the giraffe barn with their heads
intermittently poking out of the roll-up door to look outside. The calf stood next to the open roll-up door for the duration of
the inspection (approximately 15 minutes, observed first from a distance and then from within the barn). The temperature
within the barn, measured at a height of approximately 5 feet, at the center of the barn immediately in front of the stall
housing the giraffes, was 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature was likely cooler next to the open roll-up door where
the calf was standing due to the draft from the door, but it could not be measured without stressing the animal.
Giraffes are very sensitive to cold temperatures. Giraffes who do not have adequate shelter from cold weather may suffer

emaciated, hypothermic (low body temperature), hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) and not responsive upon presentation at
her clinic, with one animal markedly worse than the other. Despite aggressive medical interventions, one kinkajou
deteriorated and was euthanized the night of February 13th, 2023. The second animal remains hospitalized in intensive
care. The licensee brought two additional kinkajous (cage mates of the first two) in to the veterinary clinic on February
13th, 2023 at the AV’s request and these animals were observed by the AV to be extremely thirsty and were given fluids
by mouth before they were sent home.
According to the owner, the facility had been short staffed for approximately 1 week before February 13th. After this
incident, the licensee determined that the staff member in charge of caring for the kinkajous had not been adequately
feeding or watering them.
Staff members who not adequately trained and/or supervised may neglect or improperly care for animals. Animals who do
not have adequate food or water may suffer from thirst, hunger, weight loss, dehydration, or even death.
Correct by February 15, 2023 by ensuring that an adequate number of properly trained employees are utilized to maintain
professionally acceptable levels of animal care and husbandry. Animals must also be fed and watered adequately, and
handled carefully, in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
