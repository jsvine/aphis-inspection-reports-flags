communicate the events to the Attending Veterinarian (AV) team.
• Based on available clinical and research records, a macaque was recorded as being hypothermic throughout a four-hour
anesthesia (93.3 – 93.7 degrees F) and vomited during recovery in January 2021. The research team did not contact the
AV team to report timely and accurate information about the macaque’s condition. The following morning during routine
daily observations, the AV team found the macaque unresponsive in its enclosure. It was noted that the anesthesia and
recovery records were incomplete, and that vomiting had not been recorded in the records. Despite immediate response
by the AV team upon notification, the macaque’s condition continued to deteriorate, and it was subsequently euthanized.
The necropsy documented bronchopneumonia. Due to the lack of communication from the research team, the AV team
was not afforded the opportunity to assess the animal’s condition in a timely manner.
• Five incidences of cats not recovering as anticipated from neuroscience research procedures over the past year were
documented by an IACUC investigation. In each instance, the researcher indicated that the cats were QAR (quiet, alert
and responsive) when returned to their housing enclosure following procedures performed under anesthesia as described
in the IACUC-approved protocol. The researcher did not recognize any abnormal findings and did not communicate any
concerns to the AV team. Yet the AV team determined during same-day evaluations shortly thereafter that the cats were
in fact painful, hypothermic, hyperthermic, in shock, and/or in distress and required immediate medical intervention by the
AV team.
• Five rabbits that had undergone prior IACUC-approved surgical procedures did not receive protocol-directed gabapentin
on a Sunday in May 2021. The research person responsible for administering the medication ran out of sufficient
medication but did not contact the AV team for guidance. The research team contacted the AV team on Monday morning
upon noting the lack of Sunday medication administration. Upon notification, the AV team promptly evaluated the
impacted animals and reported that no ill effects were noted due to this missed medication administration. The AV team
provided gabapentin to the research team and it was subsequently administered per protocol. The AV team was not
afforded the opportunity to evaluate the animals in a timely manner.
Failure of research staff to make and communicate daily observations to the AV team in a timely manner can have direct
and significant impacts on the health and wellbeing of research animals. Per the regulations, each research facility shall
establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observations of all animals to assess their
health and well-being. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. Correct by 05Aug2021.
Corrective actions already in progress (05August2021) by the institution include implementation of new AV-directed,

except that provided by the three-sided, unventilated run-in shed and an ineffective shade cloth structure. The shade
factor of the shade cloth over the hay area was low and allowed excessive amounts of sun to penetrate, resulting in
inadequate shade. Upon re-evaluation of the amount of shade in the enclosure at approximately 12 pm, adequate shade
again could not be confirmed. The sheep were noted to be closely lined up along the narrow strip of shade available
provided by the outside overhang of the roof of the run-in shed. Several were standing in direct sunlight due to
inadequate shaded space availability. Temperatures for that day were recorded at 95 degrees F with high humidity.
Inadequate shade provision during periods of direct sunlight, high heat and humidity can cause significant stress and
discomfort to the animals. Upon discussion of the inspectors’ inadequate shade observations with the AV during the
inspection, the AV team immediately evaluated the animals and determined that they were exhibiting no signs of heat
exhaustion. The AV team also evaluated the enclosure and acknowledged the lack of adequate shade. Fans were
promptly added inside the run-in sheds in use at the time of inspection. Per subsequent communication with the AV, upon
fan installation, the interior shed temperatures decreased by 15-20 degrees and the sheep were reported to go inside the
run-in sheds soon after the interior fan installation. Additional high-performance fans have been ordered since inspection.

she was observed to have liquid feces, and on 12/11, when the ambient temperatures had dropped to around freezing
overnight, it was noted that she was observed to be “shaking / shivering throughout the day”. On 12/12 diagnostics
revealed that she was carrying a high load of intestinal parasites. The low temperatures rose 10 to 15 degrees for two
days, however the low on the 14th and 15th dropped back down to 34 and 33 degrees F, respectively. She was treated
daily, however on the 14th she was again observed to be shivering, and she was placed in the barn under heaters, but
she was still observed to be shivering two hours later. On 12/15 she was in the barn, and a rectal temperature reading
was 90 degrees F. Attempts to administer IV fluids and antibiotic by facility staff were unsuccessful. She was blanketed,
and an additional heater placed in the stall, but a 4:30 PM rectal temp read only 91.5 degrees F. The next day the animal
was euthanized due to further decline, for humane reasons.
The giraffe barn at this facility is constructed of wood and is not insulated. There are many openings around the top, and
between boards that make it challenging to adequately heat the barn, especially down to the floor level. The heaters are
located up high, and a recently added viewing area above the stalls appears to have made heating the entire barn more
difficult. On 12/14 in the facility’s “Manager Notes” there is a notation that staff is “figuring out giraffe stall heaters”, and on
12/18 a note states that the barn heat is “not so great” and that they are “working on different ideas” because the heat is
“sitting in the viewing area”. At the time of inspection the temperature in the barn was 58.4 degrees F at midday, on a day
with recorded low and high temperatures of 41 and 64 degrees F.
Giraffes are quite susceptible to cold, and especially when confronted with other health challenges it is essential that
adequate heating is provided in colder climates in order to protect their well-being. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate
