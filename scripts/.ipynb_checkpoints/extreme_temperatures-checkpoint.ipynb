    "1.  Recorded Temperatures\n",
    "    - We use a Regex pattern to flag narratives containing recorded temperatures (80.5 degrees, 52 F, 25 Celsius) but exclude non-temperature related mentions of \"degrees\" (degrees of rust, degrees of hair loss). We also exclude mentions of \"180 degrees\" which is the water temperature required for proper sanitization and an extremely improbable ambient temperature on Earth. \n",
    "2. Keywords \n",
    "    - We use keywords related to overheating/excessive cooling to flag relevant narratives. To avoid capture of narratives mentioning heating equipment (heating pads, heated blankets), the majority of keywords are results of extreme ambient temperatures: heat stress, hypothermia, heat stroke, frostbite, etc.\n",
