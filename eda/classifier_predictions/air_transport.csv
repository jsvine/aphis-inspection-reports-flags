95,"during the inspection a room containing bats in 1 cubic foot butterfly transports was noted. the number of bats in
each enclosure ranged from one to five. the bats were quietly hanging in their enclosures at the time of inspection
and appeared to be normal. the protocol covering these bats did not describe the housing for the animals and
specifically did not address these 1 cubic foot enclosures as primary housing. at least two of the animals in these
enclosures had been housed that manner for up to 23 hours a day since september of 2015 according to facility
records and personal statements. to meet the requirement for sufficient space for normal social and postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement, subpart f species that fly (i.e., bats) should be provided with
sufficient unobstructed enclosure volume to enable movement by flying and sufficient roosting space to allow all
individuals to rest simultaneously unless justified for scientific reasons in the protocol. correct by: 18 july 2016

laboratory technicians and a post-doctoral fellow. according to the laboratory technician, the anesthesia recovery was
difficult. the animal was checked on by the principal investigator multiple times. the pig was transported from recovery
to its home enclosure at 8:15pm by the senior lab technician. the pig was checked on by the senior laboratory
technician at 12:00am.
on march 4th, 2021, the pig was identified as injured during routine observations performed daily by the research animal
resource veterinary staff. the pig was not able to stand on its own. the pig was immediately euthanized by veterinary
staff and a necropsy was performed. the necropsy identified the pig sustained two broken elbows.
the iacuc completed an investigation with the principal investigator and laboratory technicians. according to the senior
laboratory technician, the pig injured itself when transitioning from the transport cage to the home enclosure. the senior
laboratory technician decided to leave the pig after injury was sustained without communicating any of the concerns of
animal health to the veterinary staff.

206,"on 9/18/2022, a rhesus macaque enrolled on protocol #0222-010-25 was restrained in a primate chair and transported to
the lab for an experimental session. the investigator working with the macaque did not monitor the animal continuously;
he subsequently forgot that the session was running and left the facility for the evening. the iacuc approved protocol
states that experimental sessions are limited to a maximum length of 8 hours a day and that restrained animals are
monitored continuously for physical and mental well-being.
animal care staff noticed that the animal was not present in its enclosure the morning of 9/19/2022 and contacted the
investigator immediately; he returned the animal to its home enclosure. deviation from the iacuc approved monitoring
practices and increasing the duration of the experimental session constituted significant changes to ongoing activities that
did not undergo iacuc review and approval. animal use activities must be conducted in accordance with the iacuc
approved proposal and any changes to ongoing activities involving animals must undergo iacuc review and approval
prior to implementation.
this incident was voluntarily reported to usda and corrective measures had been implemented at the time of inspection."
212,"a macaque was transported to a lab space for training on may 18th, 2023. on arrival to the lab space, the lab member
removed a back panel from the primate chair in error prior to securing the animal in position for study within the chair,
which allowed the animal to escape into the room. during the escape, the animal developed hyperthermia and skin
injuries requiring treatment. for this procedure, the animal was handled in a manner that resulted in injury and
overheating secondary to escape. handling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that
does not cause overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
at the time of the incident, the lab member responded appropriately to the escape, veterinary staff were notified
immediately, and the animal was recaptured and provided with veterinary care. the facility has implemented corrective
measures to prevent recurrence, which included the retraining of staff and modifications to the chair to ensure animals
remain securely contained during handling for research activity. this item was corrected prior to inspection on august 23,

10 holes each approximately 3/16 inch in diameter that had been added to the cover. according to the facility’s
sop for transport of un-anesthetized nhps within the main building, only sound proof and ventilated carriers will be
used.
per this section of the regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, should be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause overheating, physical harm, behavioral stress, or
unnecessary discomfort.
the design of the plastic transport container that is being used does not include an adequate number nor placement
of openings to ensure sufficient ventilation for the nhp during the time when the animal is inside the container and
being transferred between the housing room and the testing laboratories. sufficient ventilation is important to
provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
the research facility needs to evaluate the current transport container and ensure it provides sufficient ventilation
for transport, and if inadequate, procure another type of transport container that meets the requirements for
ventilation to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals.

619,"on 19 august 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per
enclosure). upon arrival, 32 rabbits were noted to be dead; several others were observed by the receiving
individuals to be in some degree of respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were
observed in an undetermined number of animals). the next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also
suspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. an investigation of the
circumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size
than the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow
between cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. the driver noted the discrepancy in the
dimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals
were loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. the driver stopped to observe the
animals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon
arrival at their final destination.
inadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to
breathe normally. additionally, reduced airflow can cause the ambient temperatures inside the enclosures to
become too high, even if the temperatures inside the cargo area as a whole are within range (this was the case with
this shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout
transit). deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the
load (33 of 380 animals).
the primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air
for normal breathing. the intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,
including re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles
used to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint
lines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation. the drivers have been trained and instructed not to
accept a shipment if these criteria are not met.
to be corrected from this time forward."
620,"the shipment of rabbits transported from oxford, mi to west jefferson, oh on 19 august 2014 was loaded and
departed at 9:20am. the driver noted making an observation of the animals at 2:04pm (4 hours and 44 minutes
after previous observation). the driver at that time did not record any comments about the condition of the animals
(i.e., if any were in obvious distress or need of veterinary care). the next observation was upon delivery of the
shipment to the final destination at 3:10pm, where it was noted by the receiving party that the 32 animals were dead
on arrival. the vice president informed the inspector that the observation procedure involves the driver putting a
hand in the space between some of the cages to spot-check the temperature. it is recognized by the handler that
the spaces between cages may become overheated compared to the overall temperature recorded by the sensors
mounted in the cargo area, and so this is the technique used to ensure the ambient temperature does not become
excessive.
the observations made by the driver for this shipment were inadequate. the time between observations was
greater than 4 hours. additionally, no notes were recorded regarding the condition of the animals, the air supply,
temperatures, or other standards; it is unclear if animals were exhibiting distress at the time of the observations stop
in-transit or not. animals must be visually observed as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than
once every 4 hours. this is to assure that animals are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient
temperatures are within limit, and all other standards are in compliance, and to determine whether any animals are
in obvious distress or in need of immediate veterinary care. failure to observe the animals within the prescribed
frequency can result in unseen stressors or unknown conditions to affect the animals and cause undue stress,
injury, or death. correct by ensuring the driver or other employee of the intermediate handler will visually observe
all live animals as frequently as circumstances dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to assure that animals
have sufficient air and ambient temperature to allow normal breathing. the intermediate handler has instituted
training that drivers must take upon hiring and then once every 2 years thereafter to be able to make adequate
observations to assure the standards for transportation of animals are being met on every shipment.

837,"in september 2013 a rabbit on an iacuc approved protocol died within a half hour after use and transport. the
rabbit was transported in an iacuc approved transport container in a personal vehicle to a collaborating institution
for use on a training protocol. the trip is an approximately 5 minute drive. two rabbits are utilized 3-4 times yearly
by the collaborating institution for about 1.5 hours, then returned. a registered veterinary technician facility
employee transports the rabbits and accompanies them while at the collaborating institution.
upon return to the facility, the rabbit was placed into its home enclosure. no significant behavioral or physical
deficiencies were noted in the rabbit at that time. about ½ hour later, the rabbit was found dead. necropsy
performed was non-diagnostic for cause of death.
the weather on the day of the incident was hot. though the personal vehicle had a working air conditioning system
that was used, the iacuc determined that heat stress may have been a contributing factor in the rabbit(cid:25)'s death.
therefore, a new policy on animal transportation was developed. animals are no longer transported in personal
vehicles or in the old enclosure system. new rabbit transport enclosures were purchased which include individual
filters and ventilation fans for each animal. a dedicated animal transport van was purchased by the facility which
provides a more climate controlled environment.
the rabbit(cid:25)'s death is a serious animal welfare impact. the most likely contributing problem was immediately
identified and the facility has taken corrective action to prevent recurrence. handling of all animals shall be done as

979,"rabbit housing for protocol 21-0242 has been significantly changed but the iacuc committee did not review or approve
this change. the protocol states that rabbits are housed at a satellite location while undergoing experimental procedures;
the protocol states that the primary enclosure type for the rabbits at this satellite location is “dog carrier” and primary
enclosure size is “24 x 17.5 x 18.5” inches. based on conversations with facility staff and a visit to the satellite location, it
is evident that rabbits are being housed in significantly smaller dog carriers which do not provide the minimum amount of
space required under the animal welfare act (awa). at the time of the inspection, 6 rabbits were housed in identical
transport crates at the satellite location. the crates are 12 inches tall, which is 2 inches short of the awa requirements.
the floor space provided by the crates is 20 inches long x 11 inches wide / 144 = 1.52 square feet; this is adequate for
rabbits under 2 kilograms (who require 1.5 square feet of space) but is not adequate for rabbits weighing 2-4 kilograms
(who require 3.0 square feet). some of the rabbits used in the study weight less than 2 kilograms, but others weigh
between 2 and 4 kilograms. according to facility staff, the animals live in the crates at the satellite location for about 24
hours, and there is no other housing used for the rabbits at the satellite location. there is no scientific justification in the
protocol for housing rabbits in travel crates that fail to provide the minimum space require the animal welfare act (awa).

1003,"the iacuc meeting minutes and an adverse event report documented an event in which a horse broke its femur
during a transport between the horse's housing area and a teaching area. seven horses were loaded into a trailer at
their housing site with no complications. upon arrival at the first teaching venue where six horses were to be
unloaded for the day the arena was locked and no one was present to let the handlers remove the horses from the
trailer and lead them into the arena. while the handlers were waiting in the truck for someone to let them in they felt
a bump and movement in the trailer. they checked on the horses and one of the horses was on the floor of the
trailer and unable to stand up. they were able to get her up and unload her from the trailer but she then laid down
again once outside the trailer. a veterinarian was called immediately and decided to euthanize the horse as it was
suspected that the femur was fractured. this was confirmed by necropsy. after action interviews were conducted
and it was determined that this particular horse was known to be a dominant, high strung horse. miscommunication
issues between the employees bringing the horses to the arena and the employees at the arena resulted in a delay
unloading the horses which was felt to be the cause of the incident. appropriate handling of horses during trailering
should include the evaluation of the horses' personality and herd interactions along with proper planning to ensure a

the facility received these chinchillas 5 days ago. they were transported individually, and upon arrival they were
group housed three to a cage by the facility. animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible
and should not be housed with other animals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort. facility staff
informed the vmo that these animals’ conditions had not been noticed by facility staff. the facility was unable to
provide any records indicating that these particular conditions had been treated medically by the facility.
daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead
to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. the facility must use appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
after the inspection, the facility provided veterinary care for both chinchillas, addressing the issues cited above.

be in good health. they were transported together and were group housed together by the facility. this morning one
pig with ear tag #6935 was found to have fresh scratches around the upper back, neck, head, and both ears. the
majority of the injuries were on the left ear where the skin was red in color, inflamed, and blood was present. the
attending veterinarian was notified about these injuries in the morning before the inspection and began applying
neo-predef topical ointment to the wounds.
animals that are housed in the same primary enclosure with other incompatible animals are at risk for injury and
stress from fighting. in some cases more dominant animals will limit access of the incompatible animals in the
enclosure to necessary resources such as food, water, etc. all animal housing systems should attempt to minimize
aggression and competition especially at mixing. the facility must ensure that animals housed in the same primary
enclosure are compatible.

1568,"three nonhuman primates (nhps) were able to escape from their primary enclosures due to the accidental opening
of the enclosures.
--on 3/18/2015, a female rhesus macaque (id#ra1021) was able to escape from the primary enclosure during a
transfer between a transport enclosure and the primary enclosure. the transport enclosure was being supported by
the leg of one of the technicians, the primary enclosure door became stuck open, the nhp was able to jump back
into the transport enclosure, and escape between a gap between the two enclosures. the nhp was able to be
recaptured without injury after approximately 10 minutes and securely placed into the primary enclosure. a frame is
available at the facility that allows the transport enclosures to be held securely against the primary enclosure door
but this procedure area did not have one on hand nor had the technicians been trained to use the transport
enclosure with the frame prior to this incident.
--on 3/27/2015, a rhesus macaque (id#rq9087) was able to escape from its primary enclosure after just being
transferred from a transport enclosure. one of the technicians involved in the transfer accidentally opened the
primary enclosure door, prior to it being locked, which allowed the nhp to escape. the nhp was able to be
recaptured without injury after approximately 9 minutes and securely placed into the primary enclosure.
--on 5/9/2015, a cynomologus monkey (id#1110608) was able to escape from its primary enclosure after releasing
a c-clamp from a metal panel on the cage door. the panel should have been secured by an appropriate lock and
not by a c-clamp but this was not identified by the staff prior to the animal's escape. the nhp was able to be
baited with food items back into its primary enclosure without injury.
accidental opening of nhp enclosures poses a risk of injury to the animals and personnel should the animals
escape or become caught in the process of opening the enclosure.
primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the nonhuman primates securely and
prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
corrective measures have been implemented by the research staff in consultation with the iacuc including
developing a training program for staff involved in the transferring of nhp's using the transport enclosure and frame,
adapting the enclosures so that transport enclosures and restraint devices can be more securely used, and
checking all enclosures for appropriate locks or other security measures prior to moving animals into enclosures.

3325,"on march 11,2021 the improper handling of an approximately 5 year old female cheetah “izzy”, caused behavioral stress
to the animal that resulted in the injury of another facility keeper/employee. izzy was being transferred from her enclosure
to an exercise yard across an employee access road that is not open to the public when the incident occurred. the
facility’s internal cheetah handling protocol requires two handlers to use a primary harness with leash, as well as a
secondary prong collar and leash to be used at all times. the secondary collar allows the handlers to have a secondary
emergency control point to de-escalate any behavioral issues or stress indicated by the animal and ensure the animal is
transporting the animal as expeditiously and carefully as possible. according to the report provided by the facility, the two
handlers broke facility protocols by having izzy solely on a harness for the transfer without the required back-up prong
collar. during this transfer, another facility employee was also using the access road to perform normal duties at the
facility. izzy lowered her body and exhibited stalking behaviors as soon as she noticed the other employee approaching.
after the lead handler thought the cheetah was under control, the handler again broke the facility’s protocol by inviting the
other employee to approach the cheetah the cat then lunged and bit the approaching employee, causing injury. both
handlers were reprimanded and will be retrained prior to reassuming normal duties as a cheetah handler.
improper handling of a cheetah can cause unnecessary behavioral stress to the animals or even injury and/or death to all
individuals and/or animals involved. all employees/handlers must follow all facility protocols to ensure the safety of all
employees and animals. in addition, all handling of animals, including cheetahs, must be done as expeditiously and
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort.

3357,"on 8/5/22, an error in shifting a fishing cat from a retreat to the habitat following recovery from anesthesia resulted in the
death of the animal. the 6 year old fishing cat named juniper was sedated for a routine diagnostic exam. she was
allowed to recover in the on site hospital for approximately 20 minutes before being returned to her enclosure. she was
placed in the retreat area which is connected to the rest of the habitat by a shift door. the protocol is for the animals to
remain in the retreat area following anesthesia and then for the keeper to call the veterinarian before allowing them to
return to the habitat. however, the shift door was either already open or opened by the keeper and approximately 5
minutes after returning from the hospital the cat was heard splashing in the pool in the habitat. the animal was removed
from the pool but she was unresponsive. she was transported back to the hospital and cpr was attempted but was not
successful. the necropsy results were consistent with drowning. the facility investigated the incident and concluded the
position of the retreat door not being visible from the keeper door (blind shift) was a contributing factor. corrective actions
were to place labels at the shift door handles to indicate open or closed position.
failure to follow the protocol for handling animals following recovery from anesthesia led the death of the fishing cat.

secured the divider mesh in his outdoor exhibit from the frame. brian was then able to push underneath the divider
mesh and attack the two adult male black lemurs (named ""buddy"" and ""junior"") in the adjacent outdoor exhibit area.
both lemurs received significant trauma and were transported to the veterinary hospital for examination and
surgery. one male lemur named ""buddy"" survived the siamang attack after surgery (amputation of half of his tail)
and treatment for multiple bite wound lacerations. the male lemur named ""junior"" also had surgery and treatment
for his wounds, but died on january 10, 2015 due to complications from his injuries. ""buddy"" has been moved to
another enclosure and it was stated that he will not be placed in the exhibit adjacent to the siamang exhibit.
the spacing (at approximately 12-15 inch intervals) and type of attachment device (hog rings) used to secure the
divider mesh to the frame in the outdoor exhibit area between these two different species of primates appears to
have been a factor this incident. the male siamang was able to loosen and/or remove several hog rings and push
underneath the divider mesh in order to attack the two lemurs in the adjacent exhibit. all enclosures housing

removing from housing room. inspect again once in anteroom. spray cages, racks, and wheels with approved
disinfectant and transport to dirty cage wash.” if followed, the sop seems to provide ample opportunity to recognize that
the two animals had not been released. as stated in the university's response, the two bats were found dead by
university staff, on november 23rd, still within the temporary holding cage in the storage room, and their death was the
direct result of ""exposure to 180 degree water"" within the cage wash. the staff employee’s failure to follow the prescribed
sop for handling these animals when the colony room is cleaned resulted in their unnecessary suffering and death.
handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
this incident was self-reported by the university on november 28th,2022, a full investigation of the incident was
performed and the office of laboratory animal care has initiated the process for termination of the responsible employee.

trip from uc davis to second research facility. the animal was being used in a heart disease study. the lamb had
surgery at uc davis prior to shipment and was considered to be in compromised health. the 106 kg (233 pound)
female sheep (ewe) was being shipped with the lamb in an enclosure designed for smaller ewes. the sop
(standard operating procedure) for sheep transport to the second facility stated that the (cid:28)large transport crates(cid:29)
used to transport ewes and one or two lambs measured 28""(cid:29) in length by 32(cid:29)"" in width, and 35(cid:29)"" in height. a facility
representative stated that in the past the ewes being used under the protocol were much smaller and that the crate
currently in use was larger than the one specified in the sop. the crate used to transport the above animals
actually measured 46.5"" in length by 26"" in width x 30"" in height, as reported by the second research facility which
was in possession of the crate. the iacuc minutes from the facility receiving the animals stated that (cid:28)""a very large

animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. the iacuc should ensure that sops are kept current and regularly reviewed to ensure
they are appropriate for their designated animal activity. the iacuc should also ensure that corrective actions for
handling issues will prevent similar problems from occurring in the future. stating that the ewe was (cid:28)overly large(cid:29) is
in this case the equivalent of stating that the crate was too small for the animal. the weight of the ewe in above
incident was only seven kilograms (15.4 pounds) more than a 99 kg ewe that is not considered (cid:28)overly large.(cid:29) the
amendment does not address whether the crates are appropriate for the size of the animals being transported, nor

12447,"facility self-reported at the time of this incident. on 12 may 2023, two rhesus macaques were taken to another building in
a transportation van for a procedure. both animals were enrolled in an approved iacuc protocol, and the practice of
transporting two animals to imaging followed the facility procedures that had been in place for an extended period of time.
upon arrival at the facility, the staff left the heater on, as the external temperature was approximately 61 degrees f and
took one monkey inside, while a geriatric female rhesus macaque was left in the van. during the anesthetized procedure,
the first monkey had complications and the staff left the van unattended for longer than usual. the animal in the van was
checked multiple times and on the second check, was found unresponsive and appropriate veterinary care was
immediately initiated. despite immediate cooling and resuscitative procedures, the temperature initially was consistent
with hyperthermia and was stabilized to below normal within 90 minutes, but the animal never regained consciousness
and was humanely euthanized. the heater in the van is not thermostatically controlled and the temperature rose over the
course of the extended study in the first animal, resulting in hyperthermia in the monkey remaining in the van. the
necropsy indicated significant comorbidities in the animal, but confirmed that the cause of death was likely heat related.
the facility temporarily stopped transporting animals offsite and immediately stopped the practice of transporting two
animals at a time. the particular van was taken out of use in order to measure the temperatures in similar conditions and
heat was documented rapidly developing within the van, which likely exposed the animal to temperatures in excess of the
regulatory standard of 85 degrees f for greater than 45 minutes. temperature monitoring was initiated in the cargo area
and thermostatically controlled heaters and air conditioning units are to be utilized in the future.

on, and the oily material did not dry during the 2.5 hours of inspection. the pattern of the substance on the crates
makes it clear it would have entered the crates, and could have contaminated the puppies in them. live dogs may
not be transported with any material or substance that may reasonably be expected to harm the dogs or cause
inhumane conditions. an unknown oily substance that could have been ingested, or interfered with the ability to

overheard voicing concern and were upset over a couple of newborn goat kids in the enclosure that appeared weak
and unable to rise on their own and thus could not nurse. one very small brown goat kid was noted making high
pitched crying noises. every few minutes it would try to lift its head or one of its legs but could not do so for more
than a couple of seconds. it was unable to rise on its own. a second white with brown on face goat kid was also
noticed to be weak and lying in a position with its legs unnaturally splayed. both kids appeared thin with a
pronounced bone structure especially compared to the other set of newborn goat kids in the same enclosure. an
auction staff member was notified and tried to assist the kids with nursing by holding them up to the mother goat.
the staff member stated that the vet tech staff knew about the birth that morning but had not been informed about
their current weakness. the attending veterinarian was consulted by the inspectors and had not been notified about
the goat kids. the goat kids were no longer present at the auction on 3-4-16.
2) during a walk through the auction barn on 3-4-16 an addax (#7628) was noted missing its left horn. there was
freshly clotted blood on its head and running down the left side of its face from the wound where the horn had been.
review of the consignment form indicated ""broken horn"". a conversation with auction staff indicated they consigned
the addax with a horn that broke off during transport to the auction. the attending veterinarian was unaware of the
addax.
3) on the morning of 3-5-16 one capybara (#176) was noted with a fresh moist bright red lesion on the top of its
nose about 1/2 in x 1 inch in size. no veterinary attention had been sought.

and wind breaks. the presence of these housing structures help protect the animals from inclement weather and
elements, especially wind and increased rainfall, allowing them to remain dry and warm. all shelters housing dogs in
outdoor facilities must contain a roof, four sides, a floor, and provide a wind break and rain break at the entrance to help

34661,"on 9/25/19 seven ring-tail lemurs that ranged in ages from 7 months to 5 years were inappropriately handled that
resulted in the death of one adult male lemur. the licensee's employee moved the lemurs from their primary
enclosures and loaded the animals into plastic crates where they stayed for 1.5 to 3 hours awaiting pick up by the
buyer. according to the ranch manager and the primary caretaker, one adult male lemur was discovered in serious
condition at the time when the animal was removed from the facility’s holding plastic crate and transferred to the
buyers crate. he was suffering from multiple fight/bite wounds. large wounds were present on the thigh, forearm,
inguinal area, testicle and the skull was described as exposed with a wound that extended down the neck. the tail
was also broken.
multiple lemurs were placed in single crates. the 3 crates each measured 24""l x 20”w x 23”h for a total of 3.33
square feet per crate. this is an inadequate amount of space for multiple lemurs (group 2 species) to be housed or
transported together. furthermore, the primary caretaker who captured and moved the lemurs on 9/25/19 said he
was unaware of the genders or ages of the lemurs and did not know what genders were placed with the injured
male. the ranch manager and animal caretaker stated the animals were checked on several times after being
placed in the crates and appeared to be calm.
the injured lemur died a few days later as a result of the trauma. immediate veterinary care was provided by the
licensee’s veterinarian and a few days later the wounds required additional surgical repair by the buyer’s
veterinarian.
these lemurs were handled in a manner that was not as expeditiously or as carefully as possible to prevent trauma
or unnecessary discomfort. disrupting the social group and housing animals of mix ages and unknown genders is
likely to cause aggression between primates. compounding this by housing them in crowded confinement for
several hours further increased the behavioral stress (increasing the likelihood of serious injury). as a result of this
inappropriate handling, this male lemur experienced significant pain and distress later dying as a result of the
trauma. animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible that does not cause trauma or
unnecessary discomfort.

a person in mississippi on 1/27/18. on 1/28/18, around 6:28pm, after being at a rest stop for approximately 45
minutes, the registrants observed the puppy in obvious physical distress (his “tummy seemed stiff”, his gums were
pale and he refused to take water, according to the registrants records). they stated they had left the air
conditioning on and had the windows open while at the rest stop. the registrants were just north of lake city, fl at
that time, and they began trying to find an emergency veterinary clinic that was open on a sunday night. the
nearest emergency clinic was about 65 miles (45 minutes, according to the registrant) away. instead of heading
directly to the clinic, they tried to give various treatments (wetting the puppy down, offering water, administering
lemon juice and attempting to give benadryl, gatorade and pedialyte) and stopped to check the puppy every 10 to
15 minutes. the puppy was found to be unresponsive and died at approximately 8:56pm on 1/28/18. it was
approximately 2 hours from the time they found the puppy in distress to the time that it died. as soon as an animal is
in obvious physical distress, veterinary care must be obtained at the closest available veterinary facility.
the puppy was taken to a vet for necropsy the following day. the necropsy revealed heat stroke as the likely cause
of the death. young canines do not have body temperature control completely developed and some breeds, like this
puppy (a brachiocephalic breed), are already more susceptible to temperature changes and require more frequent
and attentive monitoring.
the registrant must provide appropriate climatic conditions for the animals being transported. when obvious
physical distress is noted, the registrant must obtain veterinary care at the closest available veterinary clinic.
also, the registrant did not have a health certificate for this puppy. health certificates are important because it
verifies that a licensed veterinarian has checked the animal and found that it is fit for transportation. no intermediate

stated that she put apples into the inner pillowcase bag containing the young sugar gliders but was not able to observe
them regularly. she told the inspector that she was unaware that one of the sugar gliders had died sometime during the
transport.
the registrant provided paperwork that stated she had accepted another shipment of 11 sugar gliders on 25 jan 2020
that she accepted in a “sealed container”. when asked what this entailed, she stated that the consignor covered the front
and sides of the enclosure so that she could not view the interior and the animals during the transport. according to the
paperwork provided, these animals were delivered to the same consignee as above on 27 jan 2020.
failure to visually observe live animals during surface transportation can result in those animals being subjected to unsafe
conditions during travel. if these animals are in physical distress during transport the ability to provide adequate
veterinarian care would not be made available. the registrant must ensure that all live animals are visually observed as
frequently as circumstances dictate, but not less than every 4 hours. registrants must assure that transported animals
are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient temperatures are within the prescribed limits, all other
applicable standards are being complied with and to determine whether any of the live animals are in obvious physical
distress and to provide any needed veterinary care as soon as possible. to be corrected from the day forward.

36536,"female shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat distress. the dog was found inside a shelter located in an
outdoor enclosure. the inspector could hear a rasping sound coming from the shelter as she approached it. upon
opening the shelter door the inspector observed the dog lying on the floor of the shelter creating a loud raspy sound as
she appeared to gasp for breath. the dog is performing wide open mouth breathing with an extremely high respiration
rate and her tongue is extending out of her mouth beyond the teeth. the dog had recently been shaved and her skin
appeared to have a reddened tint. the dog moved about the shelter, but appeared unstable and continuously laid
sprawled on the floor with her legs stretched out. to exit the shelter, the dog is required to step over a lip at the shelter
entrance and the inspectors observed her having difficulty getting over the lip and finally succeeded in exiting the shelter
by dragging her hind legs across it. the dog continued to appear unstable and had difficulty keeping her hind legs from
collapsing. the facility representative stated the dog had never had problems with her hind legs.
the dog was moved to an enclosure inside the whelping building next to an open door with a breeze. the dog still
appeared unstable and had some difficulty moving around the enclosure and needed slight assistance from the facility
representative to locate the water receptacle, whereupon, she immediately began to drink. the dog drank water multiple
times as the inspectors watched. the dog continued to have an extremely high respiration rate along with open mouth
breathing and lying sprawled on the enclosure floor.
the inspectors observed the dog again approximately an hour after she had been moved to the whelping building, and
she still appeared slightly weak and unstable.
the facility representative stated that the dog is normally housed inside the sheltered housing building, but had been
moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning. the temperature directly inside the shelter door was between 91 degrees
f and 93 degrees f with a heat index between 107 degrees f and 109 degrees f according to the inspector's kestrel.
housing dogs in temperatures and humidity that are inappropriate could result in the discomfort, suffering, and even
death.
when climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. an animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. the licensee must ensure that all dogs are housed in climatic
conditions that are appropriate to maintain their comfort and well-being at all times.

37189,"an adult male bullmastiff died acutely during transport in september 2021. the transporter stated to the inspectors that
the animal was secured in a plastic crate behind the driver when she heard him gasping and struggling to breathe. the
transporter did not stop right away for unclear reasons relating to being “on a one lane road in a construction zone”. she
claims that when she did find a place to stop, she removed the dog from his crate but he died shortly thereafter. she
admits the dog was wearing a slip choke chain collar but claims that the collar was not caught on anything. she stated
that this occurred late at night and that the dog had fans and air conditioning to maintain temperature. the transporter
stated that she doesn’t know what happened, and has no explanation for the animal’s death. this description of the
events does not correspond at all to what she initially told the owner of the animal. post-mortem veterinary findings
provided by the owner of the dog include a swollen, congested head with blood pouring from the mouth and nostrils.
based on the inconsistencies and vague details of her story, veterinary findings, and the admission that animal was
wearing a choke type collar inside the crate it seems likely that the dog’s death was due to a handling failure involving the
collar being trapped in some manner, resulting in the strangulation of the animal. these types of collars should not be left
on an animal in a transport crate. dogs must be handled carefully in a manner that does not cause stress, overheating, or
physical harm to the animal.

present on this transport. the six year old male retriever picked up in seattle did not eat on the evening of the first day or
at any time on the second day. the driver stated that he did drink water on both days. on the morning of day three the
driver observed that the dog was stumbling and shaking when he walked. instead of contacting a veterinarian, the driver
contacted the consignor via text and phone message asking the consignor if she wanted the driver to take him to a vet
and telling her that they were about 8.5 hours from the consignee’s address. the inspector was told that due to time zone
differences no answer was obtained for a few hours. when the consignor and the driver did speak by phone several hours
after the observation of the dog’s abnormal behavior, the consignor asked the driver to offer dog canned food and then a
bit later a hamburger to see if the dog would eat. while purchasing the canned food, the driver asked the pet store
employee for a recommendation and purchased and used their recommendation of a ‘gastrointestinal synbiotic’ gel
product. the dog did not eat the new foods and during the delivery of another dog in maryland, the driver noticed that the
retriever started panting and breathing heavily. the driver called the consignor back and stated that she was taking the
dog to a vet and the consignor agreed. after a few attempts, a clinic in maryland was found that agreed to see the dog.
the driver stated that the retriever was noted to have a seizure on the way to the vet clinic. the dog was seriously ill upon
arrival at the vet clinic and was treated for three weeks with intensive care before being released for additional at home
treatment for secondary complications which are ongoing. the second dog did eat and drink during the transport and did
not exhibit any abnormal behaviors or symptoms during the trip. the driver reports that the other dogs on the same
transport all did well and were fine.
the drivers performed regular frequent observations of the dogs and during these observations determined that the male
dog was not eating and on the morning of the third day was starting to exhibit physical problems but veterinary care was
not obtained at that time at the closest veterinary facility. the transport continued and it was not until later in the day when
more severe symptoms were observed that veterinary care was obtained. if observation of dogs being transported shows

their route. the adult dogs are removed from their transport enclosure by opening the transport van’s door, then the
transport enclosure’s door is opened so a leash can be attached to the dog. the dog is then walked with an attendant, but
they specifically do not walk them within a fenced area during these leashed “potty breaks.”
the removal of an animal from its primary enclosure in commerce may result in escape and is prohibited. the registrant
shall ensure the only time an animal is removed from its primary enclosure is during cleaning of the enclosure, as required

not currently able to use the limb. the animal is being monitored by the attending veterinarian for return of function or the
need for amputation. nonhuman primates that are transported in unsafe or inadequate enclosures can become injured,
escape, or be killed. primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates must be constructed so that: they are
strong enough to contain the primate securely and to withstand the rigors of transportation; the nonhuman primate is at all
times securely contained and cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure that could result in injury; and the
doors or other closures that provide access into the enclosure must be secured with animal-proof devices that prevent
accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the nonhuman primate. correct by ensuring nonhuman
