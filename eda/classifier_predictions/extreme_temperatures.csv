4,"in august 2015, a cynomolgus macaque placed under anesthesia for a study procedure was observed to have a
low body temperature. in order to normalize the animal's core temperature during the procedure, a staff member
was directed by a veterinarian to use a hot air source; however, the nozzle of this hot air source was inappropriately
placed in a location which subsequently led to thermal injuries and later, euthanasia.
it is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,
and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform necessary or directed
duties. this responsibility shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and appropriate instruction to
those personnel.
corrective measures were taken, including but not limited to, retraining of all involved staff and observation of
techniques by veterinary staff.
this item has been corrected by the facility."
5,"review of facility records for a cynomolgus macaque which was euthanized in august 2015 due to complications
resulting from an approved procedure indicate that the animal did not receive adequate veterinary care during this
procedure.
according to anesthesia records, there was a period of over 30 minutes in which no temperature was recorded
while the animal was under anesthesia for this procedure. this is contrary to the approved protocol which states
that a rectal temperature will be continuously monitored under anesthesia. by monitoring the temperature at more
frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and addressed sooner. records indicate that the
warming blanket used to maintain body temperature during anesthesia had not been turned on by the veterinary
team. subsequently, the veterinarian authorized the use of a hot air source in an attempt to raise the animal(cid:25)'s body
temperature; however the source was inappropriately placed by a staff member and led to thermal injuries to the
animal.
a review of this adverse event indicates that although a clinical veterinarian was present during the procedure, there
was a failure of appropriate communication and oversight. the result led to the inappropriate placement of a hot air
source by an individual staff member and subsequent animal injury severe enough that euthanasia was warranted.
failure to provide animals with appropriate methods of veterinary care and oversight during approved procedures
may cause unnecessary pain and distress to the animal.
each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the availability
and use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to the animals.
the research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting a thorough investigation, self-reporting
the incident, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. corrective
actions provided retraining of all personnel involved in the procedure including monitoring associated with this
protocol.
this item has been corrected by the facility.

65,"the usda inspectors were at the holding pool inspecting where 3 belugas are currently being housed. the usda noted
that there are times during the day when the holding pool lacked sufficient shelter to protect the animals from direct
sunlight. although the building adjacent to the holding pool provides shade to parts of the pool at varying times during the
day, there was no natural or artificial shelter available that provided the animals a consistent source of shade. records
maintained by the facility for the 5 new whales contained entries for the application of sunscreen from 6/11/21 through
9/28/21. havok’s medical record included an entry on 7/12/21 that described the presence of solar dermatitis with skin
ulceration surrounding the blowhole and solar dermatitis on his melon and cranial dorsum. records also document that
the five whales have eye issues which can be exacerbated by direct sunlight. these conditions can be painful for the
animals and may require treatment.
per this section of the regulations, marine mammals that are kept outdoors shall be provided protection from the weather
or from direct sunlight. exposure to direct sunlight can adversely affect the animals’ health resulting in eye or skin
damage.

83,"on january 26, 2016 a young female macaque was found dead in the outdoor portion of her enclosure. this animal
had its head entrapped in a ball which was used for enrichment in the animal's enclosure. the ball was described
by the facility as having a hole chewed into it sufficient to allow the entire head of the animal to become entrapped
with only the mandible of the jaw exposed. this animal died at some time between the pm and am animal checks.
the necropsy of the animal was not conclusive and the facility determined that the likely cause of death was
prolonged exposure to the cold in combination with the stress of not being able to remove her head from the ball.
at the time of the inspection today the inspectors noted a few badly worn enrichment items. a couple of these
items had holes in them. one enrichment item in particular known as a ""pill"" had a hole in it large enough for a
juvenile macaque to stick its head into. this enrichment item has worn to the point that it is potentially hazardous to
animals in the enclosure in which it is being used. furniture type fixtures or objects must be sturdily constructed
and strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of the animals in the enclosure. when excessively
worn these items must be removed from the enclosure in order to minimize the risk of head or other limb
entrapment.

89,"a rabbit died after being left in its cage which was sent through the autoclave for disinfection prior to regular cage
washing. the autoclave begins with a prolonged vacuum cycle that the facility veterinary staff determined caused
the animal to die by asphyxiation. the animal caretaker had failed to notice that an animal was present in the cage.
the incident was reported immediately and the following corrective actions were taken: the individual responsible
was given a warning, the light levels in the room were increased during cage changes, cages must now be slid out
of the rack when transferring animals, and a second person will now check each cage with a light before placement
in the autoclave. staff has been trained on the new procedures. the person handling the cage, and therefore the
animal, was in the process of handling. all research facilities must ensure that handling of animals is conducted as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma , overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. corrected by facility before this inspection as
indicated above."
92,"two baboon enclosures had loops of water lines entering the cage from the top at the time of inspection. the
waterlines were attached to the source and to the cage at the water nipple. this created a loop of water line
sufficiently large for the animals to put a head through and possibly cause strangulation. facility personnel
immediately removed the water lines from the enclosure when they were pointed out by usda personnel and the
animal staff was instructed to assure the cages were pulled away from the water line origin to prevent the lines from
being reintroduced to the cages. two more baboons had enrichment devices attached to the front of their
enclosures by a rope that was sufficiently long that it could be pulled into the enclosure (but not the enrichment
device). this would create a loop of rope sufficiently large that a head or limb could be passed through and become
entrapped. personnel must ensure that the enclosures in which animals are placed do not contribute to these risks.
correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to handle animals and equipment in a manner that takes
into account the special capabilities and behaviors of the animals.
two racks of rabbit enclosures, containing six rabbits each, had water nipples that did not fully reach into the
cage. the animal care staff had not noticed that the nipples did not break the plane of the back of the cage where
they were supposed to come into the cage through a hole approximately one and a half inches in diameter. the
staff had provided water bottles to two of the animals as an addition to the nipples. having the nipple essentially
recessed into a small hole makes it difficult for the animal to easily access fresh water and could cause stress in the
animal and possibly lead to dehydration. correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to monitor that the
basic needs of each animal are easily accessible.
one cat, that had recently had surgery, was noted to be in an enclosure that contained an elizabethan collar.
the collar was not on the animal even though the surgical record said an e-collar would be used and did not have
any end date for the wear of the device. the collar is used to prevent self-injurious behavior and, if not on, may lead
to animal injury. correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained to assure post-procedural care is provided and
documented as directed.
immediate post-procedural care was outlined in the protocols for two animals but there was no documentation of
these procedures being performed by the investigative staff. an anesthesia record was present but did not indicate
any animal information past the discontinuation of anesthesia or for the remainder of the procedure day. animal
number 23161 had no immediate post-procedural record and animal number 444 also had no immediate
post-procedural record and facility personnel stated that the procedure may go as late as 8 pm at which point the
animal would be returned to its enclosure. failure to complete proper post-procedural care could lead to animals
experiencing unnecessary pain or distress and, often, the only way to monitor that the investigators are following the
standards approved by the iacuc is by records review. correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained and
document their compliance with established post-procedural care.
all of the noted items above, except post-procedural care were addressed by the facility when identified by
usda personnel. correct against the future occurrence of these items by ensuring training and instruction of all
personnel in humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation. the training must include: the basic
needs of each species of animal; proper handling and care for the various species of animals used by the facility;
proper pre-procedural and post- procedural care of animals; and aseptic surgical methods and procedures.

209,"hamsters enrolled on protocol # 2203000011 are housed in individual enclosures in a temperature controlled hibernation
chamber during one arm of the study. observation of hibernating animals for problems of animal health and wellbeing
includes monitoring of data from implanted telemetric devices and observation by veterinary staff.
in the evening of december 28th, 2022, one hamster escaped its primary enclosure. this is reflected in the telemetric
data by a loss of active data collected cage-side, indicating that the telemetric device was out of range of the enclosure.
neither research personnel nor veterinary staff noted that the animal was missing until six days later on january 4th,
2023, when veterinary staff observed damage to the enclosure and discovered that the animal was missing from its
enclosure. on review of data recovered from the device, facility representatives determined that the animal was deceased
as of december 29th.
observations being conducted on the hamsters in this housing arrangement were insufficient to identify that an animal
was not present in an enclosure for six days. per this section of the regulations, all animals must be observed daily to

350,"the facility could not verify that the guinea pig primary enclosures are being adequately sanitized. the facility currently
uses temperature-tapes to verify that the correct temperature (180 degrees fahrenheit) is reached by the automated
washing systems. there have been numerous failures of this system to reach the required temperatures and numerous
additional weeks where the staff has failed to follow their internal procedures to test the temperatures in order to verify
that the washing system is functioning properly.
temperature tape readings record whether the cage wash reaches the required 180 degrees. records were evaluated for
a 25-week period from january to june 2023. although the facility’s standard operating procedures (sop) require
temperature tape to be used a minimum of weekly, during the 25-week period for which cage wash temperatures were
evaluated, temperature tape was only used a total of 14 weeks for the rack washer and 16 weeks for the tunnel washer
(missing a total of 11 weeks and 9 weeks respectively). of the weeks that were tested, records showed that the color
change was incomplete (indicating a failure to reach temperature) a total of 7 times for the rack washer system and an
additional 4 times for the tunnel washer system showing that the systems are failing to reach sufficient temperature a
significant portion of the time. additionally, the same sop requires that when there is a failure of the cage washing
system to reach the appropriate temperature that staff must conduct additional temp-tape monitoring of temperature every
day for 7 days. for times where the color change was incomplete, the facility only recorded a portion of them as a
“failure.” following an identified “failure” to reach temperature, temperatures were monitored for at most an additional 1-2
days, demonstrating a lack of adherence to the facility’s internal sops. when asked, the facility representative states that
during failures an alternate sanitization method is implemented including the use of a disinfectant (a detergent is used in a
previous step). the facility representative confirmed they have no means of determining whether the alternate sanitization
methods are occurring or not after these known failures to reach required temperatures. based on the number of times
the system has failed to reach the required minimum temperature and the repeated failure of staff to follow the internal
sops regarding monitoring, there are instances where cages are not being appropriately sanitized.
inadequate sanitization could allow for the growth of disease-causing agents that may increase the risk of health hazards

512,"during a review of iacuc records and facility paperwork, an incident was found involving the death of a goat
unintentionally involved in the facility’s goat and sheep freunds 2020 protocol. on april 3, 2019, a donor goat,
#4630, was inadvertently bled under the facility’s core protocol involving anti-body production in goats and sheep.
the technician handling the goat, verified the tag number of the goat after removing approximately 900ml of blood
and immediately stopped the procedure when she realized it was the incorrect animal. the technician immediately
reported the incident to the facility manager. as a goat not intended for the project, the animal did not receive the
initial physical exam, bloodwork, and additional testing to ensure that it met the specified health standards written in
the protocol and standard operating procedures (sops). the animal also was not given the opportunity to go
through the facility’s typical acclimation phase in which smaller volumes of blood are drawn over time before
collecting the maximum blood volume. before the bleeding occurred, the animal did not exhibit any signs of illness.
that afternoon, the animal was found to have profuse diarrhea and was treated as directed by the attending
veterinarian. later that evening, the animal was observed in distress by a staff member and was humanely
euthanized.
the facility has well documented protocols and sops regarding blood collection procedures. the individual
conducting the procedure was trained and found to be proficient to perform this task by the facility prior to this event
occurring. the internal iacuc investigation following this incident concluded that it occurred due to human error
(failing to check the animal’s identification correctly as required by the sop).
the research protocol and sop included several appropriate methods to ensure that handling of animals used
under the protocol are handled in a careful manner that minimizes stress and physical harm (including pre-use
physical examination, bloodwork, and fecal examination). as a result of the human error in checking identification,
none of these methods were used for this animal. large volume blood collections without adequate pre-collection
testing may result in the worsening of underlying illness not obvious at the time of collection making subsequent
treatment more difficult. handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. the unintentional bleeding of the
donor goat, resulted in unnecessary physical harm and likely contributed to the death of the animal.
the facility took immediate corrective actions to address the incident. management investigated the issue,
submitted the finding to the iacuc for review, and quickly retrained all of the large animal technicians on the
protocol and sop procedures.

observed at hourly intervals until 5 pm and daily after that.
a. the following five rabbits have no documentation showing post-operative observation after instillation of the irritant into
the trachea: id# 20-0543, 20-0547, 20-0541, 20-0545, 20-0542.
b. the remaining five rabbits have no documentation of post-operative observation hourly until 5 pm after becoming
sternal: id# 20-0539, 20-0540, 20-0544, 20-0538, 20-0546.
c. the following four rabbits have no documentation of consistent post-operative daily observation: id# 20-0547, 20-0546,
20-0541, 20-0545
2) the protocol at one point indicates that rabbits will be treated post-operatively with an antibiotic (baytril) under the skin
once a day for a total of 10 days. however, in two other parts of the protocol, it indicates that the antibiotic will be
administered twice a day for 10 days post-operatively. the following three rabbits did not receive antibiotics consistently in
accordance with the approved protocol:
a. id# 20-0547 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16, 9/17, and 9/26. he received
antibiotics twice a day on 9/21 thru 9/25. there was no record of antibiotic administration on 9/20.
b. id# 20-0546 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16 and 9/20 but twice a day on
9/21 and 9/23. however, there was no record of antibiotic administration from 9/17-9/20.
c. id# 20-0545 underwent surgery on 9/16/20 and received antibiotics once a day on 9/16, 9/17, and 9/26. he received
antibiotics twice a day on 9/21 thru 9/25. there was no record of antibiotic administration on 9/20.
3) the protocol states that intra-operative monitoring of animals (heart rate and temperature) will be performed. the
following animals have no vital signs recorded during the procedure: id# 20-0543, 20-0539, 20-0547, 20-0540, 20-0544,
20-0538, 20-0541, 20-0542.
4) the protocol indicates that rabbits will be surgically prepped on the ventral neck prior to insertion of the intratracheal
catheter using a combination of 70% ethanol and betadine repeated twice. according to the internal review performed by
the facility, the investigator was only prepping the area with betadine.
making changes to a protocol without seeking iacuc review and approval does not allow the iacuc to perform adequate
oversight into the use of animals for medical research.
prior to the three rabbits used in june 2021, the pi submitted an amendment to remove the use of antibiotics, which was
subsequently approved by the iacuc. correct by 9/16/21 by allowing the iacuc to review and either approve, require
modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing
activities."
614,"the facility failed to utilize appropriate methods to prevent, control, and diagnose medical issues that arose from the
administration of iv insulin, ultimately leading to the death of an animal and hours of unresolved, low blood glucose levels
in others.
medical records show multiple rhesus macaques experienced severe low blood sugar and prolonged anesthesia recovery
times after a procedure where intravenous insulin was administered under anesthesia. after insulin administration, blood
samples were taken at set intervals to monitor blood sugar for 30 minutes. neither the protocol, nor an associated
amendment, addressed low blood sugar as a potential side effect of insulin administration nor did they include any
interventions to take should blood sugar fall to dangerously low levels.
in june 2022, a male rhesus macaque, “da9j,” experienced an adverse event while on protocol receiving intravenous
insulin. according to his surgery/anesthesia monitoring record, he remained in “stage 3” of anesthesia, defined by the
facility as “animals are unconscious or semi-conscious,” for over 4 hours until recordings cease. during this time, he
received no medical care or monitoring of blood glucose, despite being hypoglycemic at the end of the 30-minute study.
based on medical records, he did not receive medical intervention until more than 7 hours after the end of the procedure,
although he remained barely responsive and did not “fully recover” from the procedure. ultimately, the animal did not
improve and was euthanized on 6/28/22 with the medical note that he did not “wake up” from the procedure and was
“paralyzed, tonic/clonic”. the current av and program manager were unable to provide any additional information about
the provision of care for this animal.
an additional 11 rhesus macaques underwent this same procedure and also received no monitoring of their blood glucose
or medical interventions for low blood sugar despite having blood glucose levels that were so low they were undetectable
by the handheld glucometer (less than 20 mg/dl) at the end of the procedure. these animals all took an excessive
amount of time to recover from their anesthesia, some over 5 hours. per medical record review, prior documented
recovery times for these same animals after other anesthetic events ranged from about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
in september 2022 the procedure was performed again on 6 of the same animals. despite the addition of a minimal and
ineffective intervention (sugar (dextrose) injections) and repeated blood sugar measurements, records show multiple
animals had blood glucose levels that were so low they were undetectable by the handheld glucometer (less than 20
mg/dl) for prolonged lengths of time. this led to multiple animals suffering from incredibly low blood sugar without
continuous medical intervention to resolve the issue.
animals exposed to anesthesia and insulin require special attention and care to prevent low blood sugar, low body
temperature, injury, and death. animals with very low blood sugar may experience serious consequences including brain
damage, loss of consciousness, and seizures.

1. on 10/2/15 a marmoset underwent a surgical procedure under general anesthesia as per the iacuc approved
protocol. thermal support for the animal was needed during the post-operative recovery period but the heating
blanket normally used was not working properly and an alternate method was used to provide thermal support
under the direction of the attending veterinarian. the marmoset subsequently sustained thermal injuries that were
recognized by veterinary personnel during the immediate post-operative recovery period. the animal was
immediately examined by the attending veterinarian and treatment was instituted. the marmoset's condition

848,"*on nov. 30, 2021, a male cynomolgus macaque (~1.5-2 kg), a stock animal, was found dead in a slide style restraint
chair while out for a routine cage change/sanitization. it was the second time these primates had been placed in restraint
chairs. also, during this restraint period, there was a female that had to be removed from the chair due to not acclimating
well to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair with no further issues. prior to this date, it was noted
that a male had to be removed due to not acclimating well to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair
with no further issues. he was persistently trying to escape from the chair and appeared to be compromising his
respirations in the attempt. there were two (2) technicians present during the routine cage change/sanitization, one
primarily observing the primates in the chairs and the other cleaning/sanitizing the animal room.
*on march 10, 2022, a male cynomolgus macaque (~1.5 kg), a stock animal, was found unresponsive in a restraint chair
during an animal room sanitization. he was removed from the chair and the veterinary staff was immediately notified.
upon veterinary exam, no respiratory effort or pulse was noted, and he was pronounced dead. it was the second time he
had been placed in a restraint chair which was equipped with a slide style top. shortly after this incident on the same day,
a second primate began to show signs of distress in a slide style restraint chair, and he was immediately removed from
the chair and given oxygen before recovering. there were at least three (3) technicians in very close proximity. mitigation
efforts were planned to modify the chairs in this building to restrain the collar only but were delayed due to a shortage of
hardware. approximately 50% of the chairs had already been modified and the remaining were modified by the end of the
day.
the previous style of the primate restraint chairs (slide style), in combination with the primate collars and size of the
primates available, did not adequately protect the animals from injury during handling.
*on dec. 7, 2021, a male pig (5m024, repeat dose toxicity study) was evaluated due to lameness that had persisted since
dec. 6, following a toxicokinetic blood collection, during which manual restraint was used. upon palpation of the right
distal hind limb, the attending veterinarian noted swelling and crepitus, as well as a likely fracture of the mid-tibia. deep
palpation, further diagnostics and treatment were not performed due to the scheduled necropsy of this animal on that day.
euthanasia and necropsy occurred after the examination (on dec. 7). necropsy revealed fractures in both the tibia and
fibula.

875,"the iacuc conducted an investigation after concerns regarding animal care and use of cats on an iacuc-approved
neuroscience protocol were brought to their attention. the iacuc’s review of records of post-procedural care of 4 cats
documented that one researcher failed to comply with three post-procedural monitoring and care requirements as
described in the iacuc-approved protocol: headwell cleaning frequency, appropriate body temperature care prior to
return to housing enclosure after anesthesia and procedures, and post-procedural pain relief administration.
• per the approved protocol, headwell cleaning “will be done at least once per week, and more often if indicated.” medical
records review of 4 cats revealed significant deviation from this instruction.
• per the medical record, the headwell of cat 1 was cleaned only once at 10 days post-implantation in june 2021.
• per the medical record, the headwell of cat 2 was not cleaned according to the approved protocol frequency between
august 2020 and june 2021. according to medical record entries, the headwell was cleaned only 9 times, instead of the
minimum of 42 times as required by the iacuc-approved protocol. the longest interval between cleanings was 25 days.
• per the medical record, the headwell of cat 3 was not cleaned until 10 days post-implant surgery in june 2021.
• per the medical record, the headwell of cat 4 was not cleaned according to the approved protocol frequency between
september and october 2020. the headwell was only cleaned 3 times. the longest interval between cleanings was 16
days.
• per the medical records, 4 incidents document cats being returned to their housing enclosures with recorded
temperatures below the normal range during the past year. the subnormal temperatures recorded were between 95.9-
and 96.5-degrees f. three incidents required av team intervention. the fourth cat recovered uneventfully. per the
protocol, “the research team will take appropriate measures to prevent significant drops in temperature in the procedure
and in early stages of recovery.”
• per the medical records, 10 recent instances where 4 cats did not receive protocol-required pain medication during the
post-procedure recovery period were documented.
the multiple documented deviations from the iacuc-approved, protocol-directed post-procedural care requirements for
the cats indicates that one researcher was not effectively trained or qualified to perform their duties. these protocol
deviations may have resulted or did result in unnecessary discomfort, pain, and distress for the cats. per the regulations,
training and instruction of personnel must include guidance in at least the following areas: humane methods of animal
maintenance and experimentation including: proper pre-procedural and post-procedural care of animals. this item was

878,"upon arrival at the farm at 8 am on 29july2021, inspectors observed a group of 10 sheep that had no shade available
except that provided by the three-sided, unventilated run-in shed and an ineffective shade cloth structure. the shade
factor of the shade cloth over the hay area was low and allowed excessive amounts of sun to penetrate, resulting in
inadequate shade. upon re-evaluation of the amount of shade in the enclosure at approximately 12 pm, adequate shade
again could not be confirmed. the sheep were noted to be closely lined up along the narrow strip of shade available
provided by the outside overhang of the roof of the run-in shed. several were standing in direct sunlight due to
inadequate shaded space availability. temperatures for that day were recorded at 95 degrees f with high humidity.
inadequate shade provision during periods of direct sunlight, high heat and humidity can cause significant stress and
discomfort to the animals. upon discussion of the inspectors’ inadequate shade observations with the av during the
inspection, the av team immediately evaluated the animals and determined that they were exhibiting no signs of heat
exhaustion. the av team also evaluated the enclosure and acknowledged the lack of adequate shade. fans were
promptly added inside the run-in sheds in use at the time of inspection. per subsequent communication with the av, upon
fan installation, the interior shed temperatures decreased by 15-20 degrees and the sheep were reported to go inside the
run-in sheds soon after the interior fan installation. additional high-performance fans have been ordered since inspection.
per the regulation, when sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or
artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight. this item

882,"three incidents concerning proper training of staff occurred over a 12 month period:
nine cynomolgus monkeys received a medication daily for 9 days that was not described in the protocol covering those
animals. the medication was intended for a different group of animals covered by that protocol. no adverse effects were
noted in these animals as a result of this error.
a group of 8 cynomolgus underwent anesthesia and procedures not described in the protocol covering the use of these
animals. the anesthesia and procedures were intended for a different group of animals covered by that protocol. no
adverse effects were noted in these animals as a result of this error.
during a routine semiannual veterinary evaluation of a group of 5 cynomolgus monkeys, 2 animals were determined to
have poor body condition scores (bcs) of 1.5 of 5. the iacuc-approved protocol outlining the care for these animals
states that the group were to be weighed monthly, with the weight maintenance goal of 95% of free-feeding body weight,
which equates to a bcs of 3 of 5. the remaining 3 animals in the group maintained adequate body condition.
subsequent investigation of the animal care records showed that the animals had not been weighed per protocol between
march and october, allowing the two animals’ bcs to deteriorate unnoticed. the research staff did not follow the protocol-
prescribed weight measurement criteria and failed to observe the declining health condition of the animals. upon
discovery of the animals with the poor bcs, the attending veterinarian reviewed and amended the dietary plan to ensure
return to adequate bcs for this group of animals. the animals are returning to appropriate body condition.
selecting and utilizing the wrong cohorts of animals for protocol-directed activities and not completing protocol-directed
activities indicate that the personnel utilizing these animals were not properly qualified to perform these duties and their
actions put the animals at risk of unnecessary discomfort, harm and increased stress.
per the regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians,

dehydrated, but none exhibited significant impacts to their well-being. the weekend animal care staff failed to conduct
adequate daily observations, including verification of adequate water supply, yet the daily logs were marked that these
activities had been conducted.
not conducting adequate daily observations of the animals coupled with the prompt reporting of these results to the av
can yield declining health statuses of the animals, including dehydration, loss of body condition and unnecessary
physiological and psychological stress.

1212,"on january 19th, 2023, a two-year-old female rhesus macaque was found dead in an outdoor compound. her body was
found with the head inside a gap at the base of the wall dividing two compounds. the gap, located between one of the
concrete footings and adjoining metal base plate, was created/deepened by weather related erosion. the facility’s internal
investigation concluded that the primate's death resulted from the head being caught in the gap. this enclosure was not
maintained in an adequate state of repair as appropriate for the juvenile rhesus macaque. housing facilities for non-
human primates must be kept in good repair, and must protect the animals from injury. at the time of inspection,
corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented."
1219,"during this usda inspection, the inspectors reviewed the room temperature and humidity records for the tree shrew
rooms. records for the indoor housing room uuu used to house 29 adult and 3 infant tree shrews show that in the
month of jan. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 15-35% with only one day consistently above 30%. in the month of
feb. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 2-33% with no days above 30% all day. during the first half of mar. 2014
humidity levels ranged from 17-30% with no days above 30% all day. tree shrews are a species from south-east
asia that live in tropical and sub-tropical areas that are usually moist environments. during the inspection it was
noted that several of the tree shrews showed dull dry looking coats that were sparse over the tail and tail head
areas. low humidity levels can lead to medical issues such as skin and respiratory abnormalities and can lead to
discomfort for animals. all indoor housing areas shall maintain humidity levels at 30-70 percent and specific housing
room humidity levels should take into account the housed animals' age, species, breed, overall health status and
acclimation status. the facility shall increase the humidity through temporary measures by 3/21/2014 and will
correct the humidity issues via permanent long-term corrective actions by 9/1/2014."
1223,"during inspection of building k, it was made known by staff that the cage wash was not functioning properly but was
still being used to sanitize the primary enclosures of 3 white rabbits. according to staff, the instrument used to
measure the temperature inside the cage wash was not functional, and maintenance was having difficulty in finding
the correct part to fix the cage wash; however, the cage wash was still being used as the primary means to sanitize
the rabbit's enclosure. in the cage wash records, the last temperature test strip used was marked on april 29th
2014. when questioned about the reason temperature test strips had not been used since, the staff said it was
because the cage wash would not consistently reach 180 degrees fahrenheit. a detergent called steris cip 200 (a
clear fluid in white container) was also being used in the sanitation process, but no disinfectant was used for the
primary enclosure. by not having a cage wash that can reliably reach 180 degrees fahrenheit or not using a
disinfectant, the rabbit primary enclosure cannot be appropriately sanitized. proper sanitization is vital in removing
harmful pathogens that can serve as an opportunity of infection for the animals in the enclosure. proper sanitization
removes all sources that promote pathogen presence and growth. the rabbit(cid:25) primary enclosure must be sanitized
at least every 30 days by either hot water (180 degrees fahrenheit) with a detergent or using a detergent followed
by a disinfectant.

cor04a, and hpc5a, and fc17b. food and fecal wastes are to be removed from inside each enclosure daily to
prevent contamination and disease. areas which the non-human primates come into contact with must have food
and fecal wastes removed daily to prevent disease hazards and pests and to prevent the animals from becoming
soiled. to be corrected by 4-10-14."

on december 22, at the yemassee center, two employees did not follow protocols when they left two doors open
while preparing to move cynomologus macaques into the heated backup areas and 26 animals escaped the
enclosure. the employees did not follow the escape protocol and call for immediate help. all primates were
recaptured within 48 hours, with only one injury which was treated. the two employees were fired and retraining of
all personnel in proper procedures was done.
on december 29, a primate about to be treated for minor trauma escaped from a transfer cage and ran over the
perimeter fence into the woods. although searches were done the primate has not been found.

there hasn't been any follow-up examination or treatment instructions given by the av for their current conditions.
***an 11-year-old neutered male weimaraner (“atrox”, microchip #985112005669633) was observed to be very thin, with
prominent ribs and backbone and individual bones of these were overtly visible. the bony prominences of the were also
accentuated with sunken areas most notably between the ears and eyes and the jaw area, with the features of the skull
abnormally visible due to severe weight loss.
***an 10-year-old neutered male vizsla (“pongo”, microchip #985112005668866) is emaciated. when viewed from the
back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were visible. in addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent waist were
observed. bones of the front and back legs are visible, along with bones of the head. medical records show that on
8/20/22 facility staff noticed weight loss and started feeding the dog 2 feedings a day; the records from 8/20/22 state that
the facility staff will talk to the av the next monday for further information but no additional information or instructions are
recorded in the file. medical records also show that this dog weighed 64 lbs in september 2021, and 50 lbs in may 2022.
today the dog was weighed at the request of usda personnel, and he weighed 47.0 lbs.
***a 6-year-old intact female rottweiler (“sugar”, microchip #956000012067598) is very thin in appearance. when viewed
from the back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were visible. in addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent
waist were observed. on 8/20/22 medical records show that facility staff noticed weight loss and contacted the av, who
instructed them to feed this dog a second feeding of 5 cups per day until a difference was seen. facility staff stated that
they had not seen a big difference but that the dog had gained 2.4 lbs as of 8/31/22.
***a 5-year-old male yellow labrador (“dealer”, microchip #900215003196982) is thin in appearance. when viewed from
the back and side, the ribs are visible and there is an abdominal tuck and prominent waist. medical records from 7/21/22
show that weight loss was noticed. per the av, the dog is to be given a second feeding of 5 cups per day every day until
further notice. no follow up has taken place since that time despite the dog remaining thin.
***a 1-year-old red bone hound dog (“peyton”, microchip #981020039681862) is very thin in appearance. when viewed
from the back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were visible. in addition, an abdominal tuck and prominent
waist were observed. this dog was seen by the av on 9/23/22, when it was noted that the dog’s ribs were showing and
the av recommended retiring him from the study. the facility plans to re-home the dog, but in the meantime no treatment
is being provided to help this dog return to a normal body weight.

***there are 8 broken or non-functional guillotine doors in dog kennels housing dogs in building 1. there is one broken
guillotine door in a dog kennel housing a dog in the “retirement building”. these guillotine doors are used to separate the
indoor and outdoor sections of each dog kennel. broken doors can injure the animals, and can make it difficult to maintain
adequate temperatures within the building during periods of inclement weather.
***in building 3, the outdoor portion of a kennel has a chain link gate that is being held closed with a broken, rusted clip
and chain. this kennel contains 1 adult yellow lab and 1 adult chocolate lab; both dogs are very energetic and were seen
jumping on the gate. gates that are not held closed securely may break open, permitting animals to escape which can
result in injury.
***in the two outdoor exercise pens at the front of the property, there are areas of chain link fencing that are not in good
repair. the pen on the left side (as seen from the road in front of the property), which contained an adult female
rottweiler, has approximately 4-foot tall chain link fencing in which a top bar section of fence has become disconnected
from support posts. the same issue is also present in a section of the fence of the exercise yard between building 1 and
the road.

(including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm) in accordance with a schedule approved by the av, unless
otherwise required by a research protocol approved by the committee at research facilities. given the frequent
occurrence of hookworms and whipworms in dogs at this facility, the presence of chronically thin dogs, the warm climate,

between holding cage and chair apparatus. two technicians were present as per approved standard operating
procedure (sop) for this activity. the second technician inaccurately thought the pole was secured to the animal's
collar but was not able to visually confirm this prior to opening the door to the enclosure, allowing the animal to
escape into the procedure room. no secondary restraint method (eg. nets or darting equipment) was present at this
location but personnel retrieved nets from an adjacent building to safely recapture the animal without injury within 2
minutes.
a net has been placed in the building adjacent to the procedure room so that a secondary restraint method is
available should an animal escape in this area.
**a rhesus macaque, ra0972, escaped on 12/30/2014 while husbandry staff attempted to move the animal
between two different styles of nonhuman primate (nhp) caging using a plastic transfer box. this box did not
properly line up between the two different cages and the animal was able to escape into the room up in the rafters
and was unable to be netted. the animal was eventually able to be baited back into an enclosure with food items
approximately 45 minutes later without injury.
a new transfer system has been acquired by the facility that will universally attach to all caging types for nhp's,
minimizing the risk for recurrence.
**a rhesus macaque, rq9461, was being moved using pole and collar restraint for conditioning to a chair
apparatus and bit down on the pole hard enough to damage the lower left canine tooth, fracturing the tooth down to
the root. a clinical veterinarian was called and was able to remove the tooth and pack the wound. the clinical
veterinarian stated that the animals may fight the pole and collar restraint when being moved toward a box used to
weigh the animals.
a new scale and method for weighing the animals and additional refinements made to pole and collar conditioning
have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of this type of incident.
animal escapes pose a risk of injury and/or behavioral stress to the animals and to the personnel involved.

should have been noticed and been allowed access back into the indoor enclosure with the animal's cage mate.
the animal was found in the morning, assessed to be in good health, and returned to its enclosure.
veterinary and husbandry staff have implemented a program to include daily frequent checks of dog kennel housing
to prevent recurrence of this incident.
separation from its cage mate and not being allowed to have access to the indoor portion of the sheltered housing
facility could cause behavioral stress and/or unnecessary discomfort from exposure to the elements.
handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause

groundhogs were not approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc).
the protocol states that transport “will be via usda-approved commercial carriers and csu personnel will not do
the transport.” on or around april 13, 2016, protocol personnel utilized a rental commercial vehicle and transported
22 groundhogs from new york to the facility. the vehicle was not climate controlled.
the protocol further states that the animals would be housed at the facility. at the request of the principle
investigator, 8 groundhogs pups were removed from the facility by protocol personnel within approximately six days
of birth. these animals were transported by protocol personnel to and from their residences on a daily basis. seven
of these eight groundhogs pups died, some of which died at one of the residences.
the iacuc was not made aware of these significant changes by the principle investigator.
unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the iacuc

1970,"***in september 2016 the facility self-reported an incident to the office of laboratory animal welfare (olaw) and
usda. the facility suspended a protocol as a result of inadequate intraoperative monitoring, as approved in the
study protocol, and subsequent failure to identify a malfunctioning heating pad that may have contributed to the
unexpected death of a rabbit undergoing a non-survival surgical procedure. according to anesthesia records, there
was a period of approximately 4 hours in which no temperature was recorded while the animal was under
anesthesia for this procedure. this is contrary to the approved protocol which states that a rectal temperature will be
monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. written records indicate that the animal died while under anesthesia and
it is recorded that the animal’s blood pressure dropped due to hypothermia and hemodilution. it was also noted in
the records that the water-heated mat under the animal had turned off, leading to hypothermia.the veterinary staff
was not immediately notified of intraoperative problems or of the animal’s death. a necropsy was not performed on
the rabbit. by monitoring the temperature at more frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and
addressed sooner. the facility identified that proper steps to ensure the health and welfare of the animal may not
have been taken because records to substantiate those efforts were inadequately maintained. the facility must
ensure that proper guidance is provided to principal investigators and their personnel involved in the care and use of
animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia at all times. the
research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
olaw and usda, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. corrective
actions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of all personnel involved, a submitted plan to ensure
adequate expertise of the research team performing procedures and amending the protocol to include contacting

cynomolgus macaque died unexpectedly during transport to necropsy after the conclusion of a mri and pet scan
procedure. the iacuc self-identified that there was non-compliance with the facility’s iacuc policies and a failure
to follow the protocol. the animal was under anesthesia during the procedure and there were gaps in physiological
monitoring (i.e. sp02, pr, rr, etco2, body temperature and bp) based on the records, which should have
occurred every 15 minutes. for example, there were no entries on anesthetic monitoring recorded between 3:47 am
and 4:26 am (39 minutes); there were no entries for temperature or etco2 from 3:47 am to 8:20 am (4 hours, 33
minutes); and there was a lack of physiologic monitoring recorded between 7:00 am to 8:20 am (80 minutes). also,
the animal experienced ongoing complications such as hypothermia, hypotension, wet lung sounds and fluid in the
endotracheal tube during the anesthetic procedure. the first documented rectal temperature near the start of the
procedure at 3:47 am was recorded as 95.7 degrees f. although a bair hugger had been placed on the animal
around 4:25am, the next recorded temperature continued to be decreased at 94.8 degrees f at 8:20 am. although
the animal’s temperature began to slowly increase after this time, the animal’s recorded spo2 dropped to 85% at
9:25 am (ranging 81%-91% from 9:25 am to 11:05 am) while previously being recorded mostly in the mid to upper
90’s. wet lung sounds and removal of some fluid from the endotracheal tube were first documented by the
laboratory veterinary technician at 8:00 am. a veterinarian was contacted by phone by the pi approximately 6 hours
into the approximately 8 hour procedure, at which time the veterinarian’s suggestions were followed. although
interventional steps were taken, including assistance from the division of comparative medicine's (dcm) veterinary
technicians, and the laboratory staff felt the animal was stable, the animal’s sp02 values continued to be low and
the animal died before the planned euthanasia. the iacuc also determined that the on-call veterinary staff should
have been contacted prior to when a veterinarian had been called given the ongoing complications noted
throughout the procedure.
by monitoring and recording physiologic parameters during anesthetic procedures at regular intervals, and as
according to the protocol and facility’s policies, changes in those parameters may be identified and addressed
sooner. this can decrease possible negative effects on the health and well-being of the animal.
the research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
olaw and usda, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. corrective
actions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of the pi and laboratory staff, requiring use of dcm’s
anesthesia monitoring record and a period of increased monitoring of the laboratory’s physiological records. this

airlines flight 387 from honolulu at 6:20 am that morning. they were scheduled to connect with an american eagle
flight chartered by envoy air for el paso, tx. it appears the flight going to el paso had problems with the cargo

any entity subject to the animal welfare regulations who transports animals must do so as quickly and efficiently as
possible. taking animals to another carrier that has no way of tracking the animals in their computer system and
leaving them with no explanation is not transporting animals quickly and efficiently.

2447,"the facility’s attending veterinarian’s recommendations regarding the provision of adequate veterinary care and other
aspects of animal care and use have been repeatedly disregarded or dismissed over the last year. events of particular
concern are addressed as follows:
on the 15th of may 2021, squirt, a 11-year old female bottlenose dolphin, had a sudden decrease in appetite for 2 days
prior to the onset of construction and repair (coping) to her pool. from correspondence on june 9th, 2021 referring to an
animal welfare discussion between the av, associate veterinarian, facility curator and training curator, the attending
veterinarian expressed concern for the dolphin’s poor appetite and requested a blood sample on this animal. the
associate veterinarian stated her concern to the general manager regarding the trainers’ repeated denial that squirt was
ill. she stated her concern for the trainers not appreciating or acknowledging the associate veterinarian’s concern for
squirt on at least 6 occasions over 10 days. per the medical record, squirt’s base intake was decreased over a period of
10 days beginning may 15th, 2021. once blood was finally obtained the 24th of may, the bloodwork was abnormal. the
veterinarians expressed concern that the construction and frequent lowering of the water could have adverse health
effects on animals in the dolphin harbor pool. the veterinarians recommended that pool repair, which required pneumatic
nail guns, be delayed in order to decrease stress to the animal. both veterinarians recommended that squirt be moved in
with a female-only group and away from a male currently housed with her to reduce stress. however, the facility curator
and training curator stated that this was not possible, and repairs continued. alternatively, both veterinarians
recommended squirt and an additional female be moved to a different pool away from the construction and male dolphin
to reduce stress on squirt. the animal wasn’t moved into an all-female group until the 16th of june 2021.
toki, a 56-year-old whale, had been maintained on a fish diet of 160 pounds that was decreased to 130 pounds by the
training curator, over the objection of the attending veterinarian. the veterinary concern was that toki historically has
seasonal abnormalities in blood work and behavior and her alkaline phosphatase was quite low (indicative of overall
health and nutrition status). the av was also concerned that toki wasn’t getting enough water (as marine mammals
extract water from fish for their hydration needs) and that the lack of food volume would cause her distress and agitation.
the av also had concerns with the training curator dictating the incorporation of fast swims and big jumps into training
sessions and shows for this geriatric whale. toki’s bloodwork was abnormal and the av believed these behaviors could
result in over-exertion and toki becoming winded, which was actually observed by both the senior trainer and the av.
the av also diagnosed that toki had hit her lower jaw, likely at the lower flume/bulkhead during fast swims. toki’s
medical records indicate an injury to her lower mandible on february 25th, march 10th, march 31st, april 6th and 7th of
2021. in a medical entry written on april 3rd, 2021, the av directed the staff to not request head in entry jumps from toki.
the training curator, who has been working at this facility for 6 months, disregarded the veterinary instructions for toki to
restart bow jumps only and re-instituted head in entry jumps including speed runs and multiple high energy jumps.
the veterinarians did not approve of a planned move of two pacific white sided dolphins into toki’s pool and strongly
disagreed the plan should proceed due to toki being medically and behaviorally challenged. the attending veterinarian
and associate veterinarian expressed concerns regarding this move during an animal welfare meeting on june 7th, 2021.
the training curator, general manager, and animal care curator were in attendance. additionally, medical entries on
june 7th, 2021 in toki’s record document the av’s concern regarding the lag move. chasing, white water and aggression
between lii and catalina, two pacific white sided dolphins, and toki had been observed and was of concern as the two
dolphins being moved into the whale pool were a mom (38-year-old loke) and 3-year old naïve calf (elelo). in the
presence of the usda inspectors, the gm, facility curator, training curator and whale & dolphin harbor supervisor, the
veterinarians expressed concern in opposition to this lag move. despite the veterinarian’s objections, the plan was to
proceed the week of the usda inspection but has since been postponed.
the attending veterinarian disagreed with the training curator decreasing 38-year-old male pacific white sided dolphin
lii’s dietary food intake from 15 pounds to 9 pounds. the av was concerned that decreasing his food base lowered his
water intake and negatively affected hydration status. this had the potential to negatively impact lii’s health. after a
discussion, the av agreed to decrease his base intake to 11 pounds as a compromise.
the facility curator & training curator were communicating with a consulting veterinarian about changes to toki's diet
without including the av in the conversation. on march 11th, they contacted the consulting av in order to justify the
continual decreases to tokitae’s food base. additionally, the training curator wanted to reduce her portion of salmon and
feed toki salmon chunks and guts. medical entries on february 24th, march 30th & 31st, april 2nd, may 12th & 27th and
june 2nd in tokitae’s record document the av’s notation that toki’s base was too low. documentation provided by the
facility confirms a downward trend in toki’s base beginning january 2021 of approximately 160.7lbs and continuing
through june 2021 to 132.1lbs despite the av repeatedly voicing her concerns. the facility curator and training curator
communicated with a different consulting veterinarian concerning the poor-quality capelin issue without discussing with
the av who was onsite within the park when the conversation occurred. on march 3rd, 2021, the av requested that the
bad capelin be withheld, and the facility curator said that it would. two days later, the av discovered that a consulting
veterinarian had been contacted without her knowledge and that he had agreed with facility curators that the bad capelin
could be fed after soaking in cold water. after this realization, the av had a verbal conversation with the facility curator to
stop feeding the capelin until a new lot could be acquired. the morning diets had already been fed that day. march 6th,
2021 was the first full day with no capelin fed out to the cetaceans.
the decisions to decrease toki’s base and continue to feed poor quality capelin to park animals were subsequently made
without the av's approval.
failure to allow appropriate veterinary authority poses a risk to the health and welfare of the animals. the attending
veterinarian must have the appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided and that they have the
authority to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care.

2453,"the facility has an older life support system. the system siphons water from biscayne bay without being adequately
treated to prevent the overgrowth of algae, which can harbor potentially pathogenic organisms such as nematodes and
arthropods. the facility maintains an “open” system for the marine mammals in dome and flipper pools and a
recirculating system in the harbor and whale pools. the pompano pools 1, 2 and 4 are part of the dome open system.
pompano 3 is a separate closed system that is chilled. the golden dome and flipper pools housing 10 harbor seals, 14
california sea lions and 4 bottlenose dolphins were observed to have inadequate circulation and water flow. the facility
previously had a designated water quality specialist who was responsible for overseeing and analyzing the water quality
in all the marine mammal pools . at the time of inspection, inspectors observed pinnipeds and cetaceans with chronic eye
conditions and/or skin conditions. the facility’s water quality records were reviewed going back to september 2018.
chlorine in 55-gallon barrels is added into the water system using pumps that must be manually adjusted by life support
staff. total and free chlorine readings were taken daily during 2020 until midsummer. since that time, the staff continued
testing free chlorine daily but reduced total chlorine testing to once a week. within the last week from the date of
inspection, the facility had increased the frequency of testing total chlorine to three times a week
(sunday/wednesday/friday). an inspector shadowed the life support staff while they explained how and where each
water sample was taken from the many marine mammal pools. inspectors found that the free chlorine ranges the life
support staff used to manually adjust the chlorine pump were different than those listed on the water quality records
provided for review by inspectors. there were several instances where the written water quality records had the total
chlorine values recorded as lower than the free chlorine from samples which were presumably taken at the same time.
this is inaccurate as total chlorine is the sum of free chlorine plus any combined chloramines in the system.
during the inspection of the whale stadium, the inspectors noted that the water in a and b pool was very turbid and the
bottom of the pool could not be visualized. the animals were observed to be squinting while inspectors attempted to take
photographs of both eyes. the inspectors gained access to two of the lower viewing windows in a non-public area under
the whale stadium. the tank bottom could not be observed, and heavy particulate matter was suspended throughout the
water column. upon review of medical records for the cetaceans in the stadium, a number of water quality concerns were
noted.
on april 26th, 2021, a pump broke under the whale stadium. cloudy water and foam bubbles accumulated at the surface
of the pool. the back-up pump was left off during the night because of all the loud sounds and vibrations it made and
turned on during the day for cooling purposes until the pump could be repaired.
on april 28th, 2021, it was noted that the back-up pump was again turned off so as not to disturb the animals because of
increased noise and vibrations and again turned on during the day for cooling the water. toki, the 56-year-old orca
appeared agitated during the day.
on april 30th, 2021, toki had visible white lines in her eyes which were indicative of injury from chlorine.
on may 6th, 2021, it was noted that the chlorine setting in the nighttime was running at a high pump percentage level that
could negatively impact toki's eyes at night.
a review of the water quality records for flipper pool identified a spike in free chlorine measured at 1.620 ppm and a
spike in total chlorine measured at 1.160 ppm on march 3rd, 2020. a comment written by life support staff indicated that
the chlorine was turned off, and the chlorine pump and injector were replaced. the subsequent free chlorine readings for
flipper pool then dropped lower than the facility’s own suggested range of 0.3-0.5ppm for approximately the next 27
days. for example, readings taken on march 7th, 9th, 10th, 14th, 17th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th, 27th, and april 9th showed
free chlorine measured at 0.00ppm or testing was not done at all. a conversation with the attending veterinarian identified
a correlation between the lack of chlorine added to the water for that time period and the rise of clinical signs in the
animals related to an increased algae and parasite load in the water. trainers began reporting increased twitching,
chuffing and self-mutilation (rubbing, etc.) exhibited by the dolphins in the pool as well as other species (sea lions &
manatees) throughout the park. the attending veterinarian evaluated samples of the algae floating in flipper pool and
observed several species of parasites – nematodes, arthropods, and other unidentified species. the flipper pool recently
acquired a new uv filtration system, though the facility has not addressed the lack of circulation in the dead spots of the
lagoon area.
the manatee celebrity pool was also affected by the lack of chlorine and subsequent increase in parasite load. a review
of medical records for camlee, an adult female west indian manatee, described a severe clinical presentation of diffuse
nematode larval migrans with a secondary bacterial infection. skin biopsies showed nematodoiasis. parasites that were
identified include arthropods (mites), copepods, and nematodes. the av prescribed appropriate medications as well as
copper treatments to the water. within 24 hours of the copper treatment, all three manatees began eating normally.
a review of the water records for the golden dome pool show consistently high levels of free chlorine, especially within
the last 3 months of 2021. on june 1st and 3rd, the free chlorine was 1.0 ppm. on the 15th of may, the free chlorine was
1.0ppm. on the 16th of may, the reading was 0.94ppm. on the 18th and 20th of may, the readings were both 0.87ppm.
on the 22nd of may, the free chlorine was 1.0ppm. the free chlorine reading for the 29th of may was 0.82ppm. going
back further, the free chlorine measured between 0.83 and 0.87 ppm on april 2nd, 3rd, and 5th. the facility curator and
life support staff stated that chlorine is intentionally added to the golden dome show pool at higher levels since the water
from that pool “filters” back into the additional feeder and training pools for the seals and sea lions. free chlorine levels in
these pools were observed to be 2-3 times lower than those of the show pool.
while the facility has consistently measured free chlorine levels in their pools, total chlorine testing is crucial because it
includes both free chlorine and chloramines. chloramines are much more irritating to skin, eyes, and lungs than free
chlorine. the higher levels of free chlorine, and subsequently total chlorine, may be contributing to the skin and eye
problems seen at the facility. industry standards for total chlorine levels are under 1ppm for marine mammals.
the facilities current method for measuring total chlorine is not a reliable method and may be giving lower readings than
actually observed. there were many instances where the total chlorine recorded was a value that was less than the free
chlorine taken at the same time. furthermore, the manual method of adjusting the chlorine pump according to the free
chlorine levels is imprecise. using a consistent and accurate method to measure total chlorines is required to accurately
assess the water quality for all marine mammal pools at the facility.
the water that is provided to the marine mammals has evidence of the presence of organisms such as nematodes,
arthropods, and other unidentified species that have caused discomfort, harm, or serious injury to the animals and have
the potential of causing more problems in the future. providing resident animals with water free of pathogens or harmful
organisms is a critical factor in their well-being.

stress and were walking around the enclosure. one brown llama with a white face appeared to be weighed down by its
coat while walking. according to the representative, these llamas would normally blow out their coats on their own, but the
llamas are older in age.

2940,"there is no shelter provided for six reindeer in an outdoor paddock. this inspection was conducted in january with
extreme temperatures and these animals did not have a way to escape the inclement weather. shelter must be
provided to these animals in order to protect them from the sunlight and the inclement weather. the facility must
develop a means to provide these animals with shelter.

2987,"at the time of the inspection, the cooler temperature in the commissary was 41.9 deg f with a reading of 99% humidity.
high humidity levels are associated with mold growth, which was found on the seal of the doors. coolers should be cold
and dry to protect perishable food items from contamination and deterioration. this cooler should be addressed to
adequately store refrigerated food items for the health and wellbeing of the non-human primates.

2999,"*** during the inspection the temperature was approximately 45 deg f and it rained a light steady rain all day. the
tiger out on exhibit was waiting by the shift door and did not have access to a shelter area to get out of inclement
weather. also the zebra were standing near their barn door that was also closed. the facility states it has protocol
for the animals to have access to their holding areas in inclement weather or when the temperatures fall below a
certain point, but these protocols were not being followed. this needs to be addressed with the facility staff and
animals given access to allow them the choice to get out of inclement weather.

time, exposing the bolts which are protruding and pose a potential safety hazard to the capybara. these bolts need to be
removed for the safety of the capybara.
*** the fabric weather strip along the slide door for the tuffed deer enclosure is in disrepair and appears to have been
chewed along the bottom portion of the door. this poses a potential ingestion hazard to the deer. this section of weather
fabric needs to be replaced or repaired for the safety of the deer and to keep the enclosure in good repair.
*** the bighorn sheep surface rockwork is in disrepair and needs to be addressed. several large sections have cracks
and missing sections of the surface layer deteriorating along the right side of the exhibit just under the shelter area. this
can pose a potential hazard for the animals and needs to be addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair.

3035,"at least 33 red fox and 5 raccoon are housed in enclosures with shelter boxes that do not provide adequate space:
- 3 large shelter boxes measuring 3 feet long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 5 adult-sized red fox each
- 2 large shelter boxes of the same dimensions were provided to 4 adult-sized red fox each
- 1 small shelter box measuring 2 feet long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 3 adult-sized red fox
- 2 small shelter boxes (measurements unknown but height clearly shorter than the tallest fox when standing in a normal
position) were provided to at least 2 red fox each
- 1 small shelter box measuring 30 inches long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 5 adult-sized raccoon
the licensees stated that many of these groups of animals were either spring or summer babies, and should already have
been moved, but they do not currently have enough cages. inadequate space, especially within the shelter areas, may
lead to animals being excluded from protections from inclement weather. correct by providing enclosures with adequate
space to allow each animal within the enclosure to make normal postural and social adjustments, including standing in a
naturally erect position, with adequate freedom movement.
correct by 12/20/2021."
3056,"many of the arctic fox wire mesh enclosures only have a covering directly over the top of the enclosure. this covering
does not constitute a shelter and does not provide protection from inclement weather that may come through the
enclosures sideways. animals must be provided a shelter to prevent any discomfort the animals may experience."
3058,"*** at the time of the inspection two fox kits were housed in an enclosure that is designed for a chinchilla. the kit cannot
stand fully on all four, as his head is slightly down and his ears are touching the top of the enclosure. this enclosure does
not provide enough space for the animal to stand up, turn and move with any freedom of movement appropriate for the
species. additionally, being housed in this size of enclosure does not allow the animal to grow normally as the animal will
have to compensate his body posture for the small space.
*** four raccoon kits that are being bottle fed in the office area, are housed in a small crate that does not provide
adequate space and freedom of movement. several of the kits were highly active climbing and hanging on the top of the
crate and biting the bars of the door. lack of space at a developmental age can contribute to abnormal behavior patterns
such as repetitive head movements and excessive biting of bars that can wear and break teeth. these animals need to be
housed in an enclosure that provides space to allow for postural adjustment and freedom of movement.

*** multiple adult raccoons in wire enclosures were engaging in behavior patterns of pacing and circling in a repetitive
pattern that is abnormal for the species. these are wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with a dome shape wire cover
and a wood nest box. despite being a nocturnal species, most of the raccoons were awake and several engaged in these
abnormal behaviors. one raccoon had hair loss on his tail which can be an indicator of stress. in addition, the licensee
states that any additional stress (like an additional person in the area) can cause the raccoons to kill their offspring. killing
of offspring is also a strong indicator of space issues when the animal does not feel safe or have ability to avoid stress in
this environment.
*** a red fox was engaging in repetitive pacing behavior against the far wire mesh of his enclosure. this is also a wire
mesh enclosure up off the ground with a dome shape wire cover and a wood nest box. this is a wire mesh enclosure that
does not have any complexity to allow for the fox to have normal postural adjustments and social adjustments such as
digging or climbing and does not provide adequate freedom of movement for the species.
*** the arctic foxes are housed in wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with 2-3 animals in an enclosure. there are no
hide boxes or shelter for inclement weather in these enclosures. several of these animals were pushing themselves up
the sides of the wire mesh enclosures and climbing over each other to get away from the inspector or freezing in place.
these enclosures do not provide enough space to allow for any postural or social adjustments for the foxes to have a
place to hide or remove themselves from a stressful situation.
*** a coati mundi was racing about his enclosure in a repetitive manner in a frantic motion while his cage mate stood in
the entrance to the den box seemingly blocking his entrance to the den area. there is nothing of complexity in the
enclosure that would provide for a second den areas for both animals and this abnormal behavior pattern can be
indicative of stress due to lack of space in this enclosure.

3066,"thirty-five animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care. these animals were not identified
by the license prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the
attending veterinarian.
- one white colored red fox was identified as being in very poor body condition. this fox co-housed with another white
colored red fox in an enclosure with two green cards with the number “8” on them. the hips, pelvis, ribs and shoulder for
this fox were easily visible. it had poor hair coat and a pronounced abdominal tuck. there was no food or water was
present in the enclosure when first identified by inspectors. when water was provided both fox in the enclosure drank, the
severely underweight fox drank for a prolonged time (approximately 3 minutes) stopping only briefly when interrupted or
when it went to look in the food bowl. when asked the licensee stated that this was “old”, approximately 10 years old, and
that some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot. he agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that
or his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection. poor body condition can indicate a
lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. particularly when combined
with increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the
attending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be
prescribed. failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can
lead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death.
- one adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the
majority of its body. there were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the
animal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds. the hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck
area. the licensee stated that he hadn’t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to
fleas. he agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal.
- one skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown
toenails. the nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal
positions. this skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk. when observed trying to groom its face, the
animal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable. excessively long nails can cause
abnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals. prolonged
severely overgrown nails can lead to chronic musculoskeletal abnormalities and may be painful. in addition to this skunk,
at least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their
health and comfort.
- one adult skunk present in enclosure r2c1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface
of the right eye. additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye. the licensee stated
that he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract. there was no discharge,
however, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts). ocular
conditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious,
traumatic, or inherited.
- five of the six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. the two black and one white alpaca had long
matted cords of fiber dangling from their body past their knees. the others had more tightly matted fiber over their trunk
and back. the amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. that alpaca was
excessively thin with a very prominent spine. body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount
of fiber present. the licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall. excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to
discomfort and overheating in the hot summer months. additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to
keep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.
- one brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip. this
animal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca’s weight / body condition. proper
occlusion of incisors is necessary for grazing.
- one juvenile fallow deer had approximately 10-12 black raised roughly circular rough dark colored wart-like growths on
both sides of its face. these ranged from approximately ½ to 2 cm and were primarily around the eyes and mouth. when
pointed out to the licensee, he stated he thought they were just flies. skin growths can be caused by a variety of agents
including several which may be contagious to other animals (such as when caused by viruses).
- one standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) had hair loss on its rump and entire tail. the
hair that was present was short appearing nearly even with the skin. the licensee stated that this animal was “molting”
and “sometimes they do that”, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. hair with this type of extremely
short appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted such as self-
barbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes. communication with
the attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause
and prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.
- one grey colored mink had hair loss on the tip of its tail. and area approximately 1 cm long was nearly hairless. the
licensee stated that he had not observed the hair loss in his animal, but that sometimes mink pull or chew their fur out.
hair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. when self-
induced, hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological dysfunction, or other problems.
failure to adequately observe animals daily and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal health and behavior to the
attending veterinarian (av) in a timely manner, prevents the provision of adequate veterinary care and can lead to
worsening of the condition for individuals and/or failure to prevent disease in other animals. correct by ensuring that the
animals and conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animal can be properly
examined, diagnosed, and treated. additionally, ensure that animal’s daily observation of animals is adequate to identify
those with signs of abnormal health and behavior and that there is direct and frequent communication of those
observations to the attending veterinarian."
3081,"the licensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care including the provision of emergency veterinary care to one
bennett’s wallaby. at approximately 3 pm, inspectors noticed that this animal was down (laterally recumbent) in the
outdoor portion of the primary enclosure. from outside the enclosure, it was clear that the wallaby was not responsive
and had shallow breathing. the licensee entered the paddock, and the wallaby was minimally responsive even when
carried out of the paddock. it was unable to lift its head and was cold to the touch. the breathing was rough and
sounded wet and there was dried mud on the tail and muzzle of the wallaby. the licensee moved the wallaby to a warm
room and wrapped it in blankets. the inspection was temporarily halted so that the licensee could contact a veterinary
and obtain emergency veterinary care.
the program of veterinary care instructed that emergency services would be provided by the attending veterinarian’s
clinic. the licensee called the clinic and was advised that the av was seeing patients until 6 pm. initially the licensee
requested that the av come to the property when he finished. aphis officials then advised the licensee that the
inspection could be stopped at that time if he was able to bring the wallaby to the vet for emergency care. the licensee
called the office staff and left a message regarding the condition of the wallaby asking if he could bring it for treatment.
the licensee moved the wallaby to a warm vehicle so that he could transport it to the clinic, however, a few minutes later
the licensee received a voice message from the clinic. the clinic staff stated that the av had requested that they relay
that message from the attending veterinarian. they informed him that the attending veterinarian had stated that he did
not know much about wallaby, did not have experience treating them, and that he was unwilling to provide treatment for
this animal even if the licensee brought it to the clinic. the licensee attempted to call several other local veterinary clinics
and was unable to find a clinic willing to examine or provide emergency veterinary care for this wallaby. the wallaby was
still alive and slightly more responsive when aphis officials left the property at approximately 5 pm.
failure to provide emergency veterinary care when needed can result in unnecessary suffering and potentially death of
animals. licensees must ensure that they establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care including the use
appropriate methods to prevent control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. this includes the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care. correct by ensuring that this wallaby is examined and treated by a licensed
veterinarian and further by ensuring that all animals are provided with adequate veterinary care."
3082,"fifteen animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care. these animals were not identified by
the licensee prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the
attending veterinarian.
- one individually housed striped skunk was observed having a large amount of saliva present its face. there was saliva
extending from the left side of the mouth up its face surrounding its left eye and up to its ear and slightly beyond as well
as under its chin down its chest and over the front legs. the fur surrounding the left eye, cheek, and chin were wet to the
skin with saliva. the licensee removed the skunk from the enclosure upon further inspection the skunk appeared to have
swelling in its mouth. the skunk was slow and appeared slightly sluggish. increased salivation and swelling may indicate
dental pain, oral ulcerations, or oral wounds which can cause the animal to be reluctant to eat. excessive salivation may
also be signs of other diseases is skunk. the licensee stated that he had not noticed this prior to the inspection.
- one striped skunk housed on the left side of the mink barn was observed not being able to open its left eye. the left eye
of the animal had swelling above the eyelid and the eye was completely sealed shut. ocular conditions combined with
swelling and discharge are often painful and can be indicative of eye infections or other injury or illness.
- one arctic fox singly housed in an enclosure without shelter, was found to be excessively thin. the hips, pelvis, and ribs
were more readily apparent than they should be with the amount of fur present. poor body condition can result from
illness, inadequate feed, or other causes and requires appropriate examination determine the cause and determine the
proper treatment.
- four of the six alpaca continue to have an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. the two black and one white alpaca
had long matted cords of fiver dangling from their body past their knees. the other had more tightly matted fiber. the
amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. that alpaca was excessively
thing with a prominent spine. body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount of fiber present.
excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to discomfort and overheating in the summer months. additionally, matting or cording
of fiber reduces its ability to keep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.
- one standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) continues to have hair loss on its rump and
entire tail. the hair that was present was slightly longer than on prior inspection, but still appeared short. the licensee
continued to state that this animal was “molting”, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. hair with this
type of extremely short appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted
such as self-barbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes.
communication with the attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the
underlying cause and prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.
- at least five adult striped skunks were observed with extremely overgrown toenails. in each instance the nails were long
enough that they were curling and/or bending over one another. in some cases, they were pushing the toes into abnormal
positions. excessively long toenails can cause abnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures
disrupting freedom of movement. in addition to these skunk other animals (arctic fox, red fox, and less severely impacted
skunk) also had overgrown toenails that needed trimmed for their health and comfort.
- the adult male striped skunk that with excessively long nails noted on the prior inspection continued to have an
abnormal gait despite that the nails had been trimmed by the licensee. the licensee removed this skunk from the
enclosure so that inspectors could observe it more closely. the left hind foot had an area with tan flaky crusty areas that
appeared to be scabs and likely were contributing to the abnormal gait. foot wounds can result from walking on wire,
particularly wire that is poorly coated and or has sharp points and may be painful.
- one white-nosed coati was observed with hair loss on the tip of the tail. the tip of the tail had an approximately 2-inch
area that had extremely short hair. the next approximately 6-inches from the tip of the tail the hair was noticeably thinner
than the rest of the tail. the licensee stated that the tail was shorter than normal due to the animal being in conditions that
were too cold for the animal prior to when he acquired it. the licensee did not state whether he had observed the hair loss
prior to inspection, however, he stated that occasionally the coati will chew on their tails. he also acknowledged that he
could appreciate the hair loss when pointed out. hair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as
nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. when self-induced hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological
dysfunction, or other problems. this condition requires examination to determine the appropriate treatment.

3088,"thirty arctic fox and 57 red fox remain in enclosures without shelter. the enclosures are made of approximately 1- inch
square wire. there is a piece of tin siding placed on top of the enclosures. approximately half of the enclosures have
rectangle of solid blue material or perforated white plastic material one side of the individual pens while the remaining
enclosures have no walls other than the wire. these animals are not protected from blowing wind, rain, and snow. there
was a significant storm with a large amount of rain and wind overnight the night prior to the inspection and the weather
forecast called for overnight temperatures of 40-degree fahrenheit that evening. the licensee stated that he plans to
leave these animals in this enclosure until at least the last few weeks of november. without adequate protection the
animals are prone to exposure stress and disease hazards. shelter shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to
afford protection and prevent discomfort."
3097,"eleven animals (5 mink, 4 striped skunk, 1 red fox, and 1 arctic fox) were identified during the inspection that required
veterinary care. these animals were not identified by the licensee prior to inspection.
- one light grey-blue colored (described by the licensee as “sapphire”) mink was observed with an open chest/neck
wound. the wound was approximately 1 inch diameter and was located on the upper chest and lower neck of the animal.
the wound was open with bright red tissue visible in the center. there was yellow, dried discharge caked around the
wound stuck to and hanging from the surrounding fur. the licensee stated that he had not noticed this lesion prior to
inspectors bringing it to his attention. he stated that it likely was a “boil” that had broken open, as sapphire mink
frequently get “boils”. left untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful.
-one black, pair-housed mink was observed with an open neck wound. the wound was approximately 1x2 inches and
crusty with scabs and discharge. the hair in the affected area was wet and matted, trapping debris inside the wound. the
licensee stated that he had not observed this injury prior to this inspection, and that no treatment had been provided. left
untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful.
- one blue-grey colored mink (described by the licensee as “sapphire”) was observed with an open wound on the tip of its
tail. the wound was bright pink with dark red crusts and scabs around the edge. there was hair loss around the wound,
with some extremely short hair, nearly even with the skin, surrounding the wound. bedding and other debris was dried to
the wounded tail tip. the licensee stated that sometimes mink chew on their tails, self-inflicting wounds consistent with
this one. he stated that he had not noticed this wound prior to inspection, and had not provided any care for this animal.
left untreated, open wounds can lead to infection and are painful. extremely short hair can be a result of barbering,
which is often an indicator of stress or pain.
- one grey mink, housed in a pair, was observed with injuries to its nose and on both rear legs. there was a line of blood
or ulcerated tissue on the dorsal surface of its nose, where nose tissue meets the haired surface of its face. the feet of
the animal were swollen, with a red discharge that appeared to be dried blood, on both hind feet. it extended to the
abdomen and tail, with red crusty material dried on those areas. additionally, there was similar discharge accumulated on
the wire floor of the enclosure. the licensee removed the animal from the enclosure for further inspection. when the
animal was placed back into its enclosure, it was observed to not be using its back legs properly. the animal appeared
lame and would fall from side to side with its hips touching the wire floor as it tried to enter the hide box. leg and foot
injuries can be painful, particularly when housed on wire-flooring. in the enclosure housing this animal, the food and
water present at the time of inspection can only be accessed when standing on the thin, bare, uncoated wire. this can
easily exacerbate foot wounds. the only solid flooring is within the nest box.
- one light colored mink (white with a grey dorsal stripe and grey tips on its hair) was singly housed when inspectors
identified a horseshoe shaped wound at the base of its tail. this wound was pink, open, oozing a yellow-red tinged fluid.
the discharge crusted the surrounding fur, a wood chip was crusted and stuck to the edge of the wound. left untreated,
open wounds are painful and may lead to infection.
- one individually housed striped skunk in an enclosure labeled r4 c1, was observed by inspectors holding its mouth
partially open. the licensee removed the skunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the animal’s top and
bottom gums were swollen. the animal was missing multiple teeth. those that were visible appeared brown and caked
with hard mineral deposits, which obscured the view of the teeth themselves. the skunk continued to hold its mouth
partially open throughout the entire time it was being examined as though it was either unwilling or unable to completely
close its mouth. swollen gums and tooth loss indicates dental disease, which is often painful. additionally, this skunk had
extremely long overgrown nails that could easily become entrapped in the wire enclosure floor.
- one adult brown and white striped skunk housed in enclosure labeled w13, had bilateral eye discoloration. licensee
removed the skunk from the enclosure for a close examination, revealing that both eyes appeared dry with a slightly
irregular surface. the surface of the eyes were a cloudy/milky white with a dried crusty discharge. the discharge was
worse in the right eye. this skunk also had a brown-red crusty nasal discharge adhered to both nostrils. the licensee
stated it was an older animal and that he had not noticed these issues prior to inspection today. he had not sought any
treatment or veterinary care for this animal.
- one adult striped skunk in enclosure labeled w16, also had bilateral eye discoloration. the licensee removed the skunk
from the enclosure. on close examination, the surface of both eyes appeared cloudy with dark irregular streaks. there
was small amount of ocular discharge accumulated in the right eye corner, towards the skunk’s nose. the skunk did
appear to respond to visual stimuli. this skunk also had a distinct linear area of hair loss on the bridge of its nose
extending into its white hair. the underlying skin was normal, giving this the appearance of a scar. the licensee stated it
was an older animal and that he had not noticed this issue prior to inspection today. he has not sought any treatment or
veterinary care for this animal.
- one individually housed striped skunk in enclosure labeled w12, had a sunken right eye. the licensee removed the
skunk from the enclosure and upon further inspection the eye appears sunken with mild swelling present on its cheek.
sunken eyes in skunks can indicate dehydration, disease, or injury. the licensee stated that he had not noticed this issue
prior to inspection today and had not sought any treatment or veterinary care for this animal.
- one white colored red fox has discharge weeping from its right eye. the eye appeared clear and normal. there was an
accumulation of crusty red-brown debris extending approximately 1cm from the inside corner of the eye towards the nose
of the fox. ocular discharge can indicate an eye injury or disease. many eye conditions are painful. the licensee stated
that this issue was not noticed prior to inspection today.
- one arctic fox, singly housed in an enclosure lacking shelter towards the back of the property, has an eye discharge
accumulated at the inside corners of both eyes. the eyes appeared clear and normal. there was an accumulation of
brown wet debris extending from the inside corners of the eyes approximately 1cm towards the nose of the fox. ocular
discharge can indicate an eye injury or disease. the licensee stated that this issue was not noticed prior to inspection
today.
failure to adequately observe animals daily, and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal animal health and behavior
to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care. without adequate veterinary care, an
animal’s condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals. correct by ensuring that the animals
and conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined,
diagnosed, and treated. additionally, ensure that daily observation of animals is adequate to identify all signs of abnormal
health and behavior. ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of problems of animal health, behavior, and
well being conveyed to the attending veterinarian."
3101,"the areas surrounding the feeders, water receptacles, and entry gate of the sika deer enclosure continue to have moist
dirt. the weather has been dry, with no rain or other precipitation in the region of this facility, since the prior inspection
(conducted 9/22/22). the degree of moisture still in these areas, combined with the lack of rain, indicates that drainage
remains insufficient to rapidly eliminate excess water. the licensee stated that he continues to be unable to move the
feeders to another portion of the enclosure since the male sika deer is in rut, preventing him from safely entering the
enclosure. the licensee stated he does have a plan for putting gravel in this area to improve drainage and is just waiting
for delivery of the stone. it is unknown when the stone will be delivered. standing in the mud can compromise the
integrity of the deer’s feet, making them more prone to infection and abscess. correct by ensuring that a suitable method
to rapidly eliminate excess water is provided."
3113,"twenty-seven arctic fox and thirty- one red fox still do not have adequate shelter. the wire mesh enclosures have a piece
of blue plastic board material attached to the wire mesh between enclosures that share a common wall. this provides a
partial partition. it had just rained prior to starting the inspection and the red foxes observed at the start of the inspection
had wet fur, even though the tops of their enclosures were covered, indicating that the animals cannot stay dry during
inclement weather.
numerous arctic fox were observed frozen in position, growling and/or attempting to climb the walls of their enclosure to
escape, as inspectors approached. this demonstrates their instinctual need to hide in the face of perceived danger.
adequate shelter from the elements (such as a hide box) allows animals to make normal behavioral adjustments for the
species. lacking this shelter leads to extreme stress and possible exposure injury, especially as temperatures drop with
winter coming. the animals suffer psychological and physical harm under these conditions. correct by ensuring that
adequate shelter is provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort.
remains uncorrected."
3129,"there are multiple animals identified at the facility that require veterinary care. this included:
one adult singly housed groundhog had a severe, mostly healed, injury to the right eye. the globe of the eye was not
visible and appeared to be sunken completely into the eye socket which was still open exposing soft tissue within. there
was a large amount of fur missing around the eye and the skin was discolored (glossy white where it normally would be
pigmented) these areas appeared to be scar tissue. there were a small number of scabs and moderate amount of flaky
dried skin in this area. this area of apparent scarring covered several inches extending from the groundhog’s ear past
eye. the scabs and dried flaky skin extended nearly to the nose. the lower lid of the eye was irregular and had a healed
tear in it at the midpoint. the fur that is present on the upper eyelid had yellow-brown crusts accumulated and there were
bits of bedding and foreign material on the groundhog’s head and face and what appeared to be a small amount within
the eye socket. the licensee stated that the animal’s injury was traumatic had been previously identified however, the
veterinarian had not treated this animal when the injury occurred. failure to have animals with injuries, trauma, and
wounds examined by a veterinarian so that appropriate treatment can be provided may lead to infection, worsening of the
condition, and unnecessary suffering. correct by having this animal evaluated by a veterinarian so that appropriate
treatment methods can be provided at this time to prevent foreign material from entering this area and worsening this
condition.
one adult white colored red fox, housed in a pair, had hair loss from the base to the tip of the of the tail. the licensee
stated that this animal was just shedding its winter coat, however, the hair loss is extreme and focused nearly entirely on
the tail. the hair which remains on the tail is extremely short and patchy. there are several places along the underside
and top where there appears to be no hair present. the last 1-2 inches of the tail have no hair present and there are red
marks that appear to be superficial abrasions or wounds that may indicate chewing. while shedding during this time of
year is consistent with normal physiological changes that fox undergo seasonally, the pattern and degree of hair loss is
not typical for shedding fox and must be assessed and treated by a veterinarian. focal hair loss may occur due to injury,
nutritional abnormalities, parasitic infection, or self-trauma from psychological distress. failure to use appropriate
methods to control or diagnose abnormalities in the animals’ fur can delay treatment or cause the condition to worsen.
correct by having this animal evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose the cause of this hair loss and follow all
treatment recommendations.
the program of veterinary care directs the facility to conduct fecal testing on 10 percent of the animals at the facility each
year. the licensee stated that he had not had fecal testing completed of any animals in the last year. multiple animals
have diarrhea and loose stool at the facility. dark watery stool was present in the enclosure housing one male and one
female adult bobcat. there was approximately 5 approximately 2-5 inch puddles of black/green liquid excreta present on
the floor of the enclosure. the licensee stated that he had not seen this before, but that the diet had recently been
changed from chicken to muskrat and likely resulted in loose stool in the animals. one enclosure housing two red fox had
yellow mucoid watery stool present under the enclosure. one enclosure housing a female artic fox with her litter of pups
had significant amounts of diarrhea underneath. loose stool can be an indicator of intestinal parasites, nutritional
problems, and disease in the animals. failure to consult the attending veterinarian when diarrhea occurs can result in
delay in diagnosis and treatment causing the condition to worsen. additionally, failing to follow the guidance provided by
the attending veterinarian regarding routine parasite screening by regularly testing fecal samples can delay proper
diagnosis necessary for the prevention of parasitic diseases in these animals. correct by ensuring that the routine fecal
sampling of 10% of all animals annually that was recommended by your attending veterinarian as part of your program for
adequate care is completed. additionally, ensure that animals with active signs of diarrhea or loose stool are examined
by a veterinarian so that appropriate treatment can be administered."

skin. the humidity recorded on the kestrel in several areas of the enclosure ranged from 54%-55%. sloths as a species
are very sensitive to temperature and humidity, requiring temperature of 75-85 degrees f and 60-80 % humidity for
overall health. at the time of inspection, the licensee corrected the humidity to the appropriate range, and cosmo ceased
scratching. correct from this day, august 15, 2023, forward.

he got stuck in the shift door and injured. the experienced zookeeper started to close the heavy shift door after the male
cat was seen to be in the stall with his feed, but the male cat double backed through the door opening. the zookeeper’s
attention was focused on the female cat, in the same enclosure, and not the shift door as he continued to push it closed.
after realizing the cat was stuck between the shift door and the wall, the zookeeper quickly opened the door, and the cat
was released. the zookeeper thought the cat appeared to be moving around okay but the cat quickly went to one of his
hiding boxes. the incident was reported to a supervisor at this time. the next morning, the male cat was found laying
sternal in his enclosure, not wanting to move and the attending veterinarian was notified. a physical exam and
radiographs were consistent with a pelvic fracture. the veterinarian elected humane euthanasia as the best treatment.

3337,"at the time of inspection, the two black leopards and two tigers (described above) were in need of veterinary care
and were either not observed by the licensee or their conditions were not communicated to the attending
veterinarian prior to inspection.
*** regarding the 6-7 year old male leopard identified as backara, when asked what the licensee thought about this
animal(cid:25)s weight, he stated that it was (cid:28)fine(cid:29). the licensee failed to properly identify that this animal is extremely
underweight and as a result did not report this weight loss to the attending veterinarian prior to today(cid:25)s inspection.
*** regarding the leopard identified as jumonji, although the licensee stated that he had observed the weight loss,
hair loss and open wounds, he failed to communicate these observations to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner. the licensee stated that he did not feel that the weight loss, hair loss or lesions were abnormal for this
animal. he farther stated that he would feed and feed the (cid:28)cat(cid:29) and it just wouldn(cid:25)t gain any weight. he also stated
that the hair loss and lesions were common in black leopards and was a consistent issue with this animal in the
winter. there was no written guidance from the attending veterinarian authorizing the use of ivermectin for hair
loss, wounds, or weight loss in leopards or directing whether this drug would be effective alone or only in
combination with prednisone as previously used.
*** regarding the 18 year old tiger identified as niko, the licensee stated that he knew this animal was in pain and
showed no signs of improvement after 14 days of treatment with meloxicam. in addition, the licensee stated that
he had seen the animal(cid:25)s condition worsen in colder temperatures. despite the animal(cid:25)s declining condition the
licensee failed to contact the attending veterinarian to communicate these observations even while knowing that
the treatment appeared ineffective the animal continued to show significant signs of pain and suffering.
***regarding the three year old female tiger identified as tamara, despite observing her failure to gain weight the
licensee failed to consult the attending veterinarian and establish an effective diet plan to achieve the animal(cid:25)s ideal
weight and body condition or determine if additional diagnostic testing is necessary to rule out an additional disease
process.
the licensee failed to communicate timely and accurate information on the above listed matters of animal health,
behavior, and well-being to the attending veterinarian in an in a timely manner. failure to accurately report these
conditions in a timely manner delays the provision of appropriate care and can prolong unnecessary suffering and
potentially allow for progression of disease. the licensee must provide an effective method of communication so
that problems are reported to a veterinarian in an timely and accurate manner.
*** a 1-year old female cougar identified by the licensee as makhia was found dead by the licensee since the last
inspection. this animal was observed by inspectors during the previous inspection and was found to be in poor
body condition (significantly underweight) at that time. the licensee stated that he found her inside the den a few
days prior to this inspection and that he believed her death resulted from injuries sustained by the other 1-year old
female cougar housed in the same enclosure (identified as abby). an accurate or precise date of the animal(cid:25)s
death could not be established due to conflicting statements made by the licensee and the attending veterinarian.
the licensee stated that the av had examined the body of the dead cougar and determined her death was caused
by the cage mate. the av later informed inspectors that the he had not seen the cougar(cid:25)s body and only heard
about the incident the day of inspection (29 january). without a post mortem examination, it is impossible to
determine whether this death resulted from aggression / trauma from a cage mate (as suspected by the licensee),
the effects of prolonged malnutrition / starvation, or another disease process. given the number of other large cats
present on this property in poor body condition and / or actively losing weight, determining a cause of death is
necessary to evaluate the continued risk to other animals in the population. failure to communicate this death to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner prevented them from providing adequate guidance regarding
necessary post mortem testing that could yield important information used to prevent disease progression (whether
from infectious cause or inadequate feeding) or provide guidance on other issues of animal welfare such as
appropriate segregation of aggressive animals which could be used by the facility to prevent future suffering of other
animals at this facility. correct by ensuring that information regarding all unexpected animal deaths are
communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner and ensuring that appropriate postmortem

space. the cougar had mud covering the tail, all 4 paws, and lower portion of the legs up to the level of the carpus
and hocks. prior to the inspection there was snow and warming temperatures had caused the snow to melt. the
licensee stated that the enclosure was muddy and the standing water was present only because of the snow. he
stated that the snow gets into the pen and as it melts the enclosure becomes wet. additionally, he stated he covers
the enclosure with a 3 inch layer of mulch to ensure that the enclosure stays dry. when asked how frequently he
does that, the licensee replied (cid:28)a couple of times a year(cid:29). no mulch was evident on the floor of this enclosure.
large feline carnivores must have access to a dry clean space. the inability to access dry housing area is
distressful and when prolonged, may lead to the development of husbandry and sanitation related illness such as
skin infections. constant environmental moisture not only can promote infections but also affects the animal(cid:25)s

dead hamster pups in this enclosure. one of these was fresh and partially cannibalized. the second was older and
consisted only of dried fur and skin.
~ animal 5: one male tan long-haired syrian hamster was housed with a single other adult hamster in room
#17, rack #3, row #3, box #19. this hamster had incomplete hair loss / thinning over the hind end of the body. the
underlying skin was dry and had numerous scabs. the facility representative stated that this was likely bites from
the other hamster and separated them when identified by aphis officials.
~ animals 6-15: one brown female syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 9 live pups) in room
#17, rack #3, row #1, box #5. the adult hamster had a moderate amount of wet brown debris under the tail
consistent with diarrhea. the hamster pups were all wet over the fur on the backs and had varying degrees of
diarrhea on their hind end. in addition to the live animals there was also 1 dead pup in this enclosure.
~ animals 16-22: seven juvenile gerbils were housed in room 5 of the 'main building' in rack #16, row #4, box
#7. this included 3 brown, 1 white, 2 black, and 1 tan all of which had areas of dark red-brown scabs over their
back and/tails. the most severely affected was the white gerbil which had scabs extending from the back of the
neck down the back to the base of the tail as well as hair loss in those areas. the licensee stated that there
appeared to be some aggression in this enclosure and removed the one animal that had the least amount of scabs,
presumed to be the aggressor and separated the enclosure for observation.
~ animal 23: one black russian dwarf hamster was housed with 7 other hamsters in box 5 of the hallway near
room 5 of the main building. this hamster had a large area of hair loss covering 1/4 to 1/3 of its head between the
eyes and ears. the skin underlying this area of hair loss had three large scabs present.
~ animal 24: a white chinchilla was observed with hair loss on the sides of both ears. there was also some
scabbing in this area. this can be an indication that there is a medical issue. this animal had not yet received
veterinary attention. measures need to be taken to provide appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner in order
to prevent the animal unnecessary pain and distress.
~ animal 25: a black chinchilla was observed to have hair loss on its neck area. this hair loss extended full circle
around the entire neck. hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. this animal had not yet received
veterinary attention for this condition.
~ animal 26: a grey chinchilla was observed with an abnormal reddening area around its eyes with areas of hair
loss. there was crusty discharge on both eyes and nose, and a cloudy discharge on the left eye. the eyes were
sunken in and the chinchilla was huddled in the enclosure and appeared depressed and lethargic. these signs are
indicators of a negative health issue and suggestive of systemic disease and animal discomfort. the animal had not
yet received veterinary care for this issue.
~ animal 27: a white chinchilla was observed with hair loss between its ears on the back of its neck. the skin
underneath was bright pink in color. hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. this animal had not yet
received veterinary attention for this condition.
~ animal 28: a black chinchilla was observed with a cloudy ""hazy"" appearance in both eyes. this condition
affected the center of the eye in the middle of the cornea. there was a discharge noted in the left eye. this could
be an indication of a serious underlying medical issue and can cause distress to the animal. the chinchilla had not
received vet care for this condition.
~ animal 29: a black chinchilla was observed squinting with a discharge from both eyes. the animal was not
opening the eye fully, which may be an indication of discomfort or pain. the animal remained huddled in the corner
of the enclosure and seemed reluctant to move around compared to the normal movements of the healthy
chinchillas. the chest area was wet and had a crusty appearance. the chinchilla had not received vet care for this
condition.
~ animal 30: a white chinchilla was observed with a discharge from both eyes. this can be an indication of a
more serious illness affecting the animal, and could possibly cause distress to the animal. the chinchilla had not yet
received veterinary care for this issue.
~ animal 31: in the hut on the top row bin 1 a black and white guinea pig was observed with a crusty discharge
from the left eye. the animal was not opening the eye fully, which may be an indication of discomfort. the guinea
pig had not received veterinary care for this issue.

closed and had an accumulation of light brown crusty debris present.
~ animal 33: one tricolor abyssinian-type guinea pig was present in the ""hut"" building on the male rack, row #5,
tub #3 (co-housed with 13 other guinea pigs). this guinea pig had a small circular area of hair loss just above the
nose with a small central scab. the surrounding skin was dry and crusty.
~ animal 34: one light tricolor rough coated ""teddy-bear"" type guinea pig was present in the ""hut"" building on the
male rack, row #5, tub #3 (co-housed with 14 other guinea pigs). this guinea pig had a right eye that was being
held partially closed and had brown crusty debris on the upper and lower lid accumulating in the corner of the eye
closest to the nose.
~ animal 35: one white abyssinian-type guinea pig with a brown patch near the eye was present in the ""hut""
building on the male rack, row #2, tub #8 (co-housed with 14 other guinea pigs). this guinea pig had a left eye that
was being held partially closed. there was a small amount of crusty debris accumulated along the lower lid and at
the corner nearest the eye.
~ animal 36: one grey agouti with white guinea pig with a single rosette on the head (crested / american-type)
was present in the ""hut"" building of the male rack, row #4, box #8 (co-housed with 9 other guinea pigs). this
guinea pig had a left eye that was completely sealed shut with brown crusty debris. when examined the eye could
not be opened with gentle wiping.
the facility maintains an area within each room for animals requiring additional care, however, none of the animals
listed above were identified by facility staff prior to inspection. all of these animals / enclosures were mixed with the
general population of animals in their respective rooms. the clinical signs of hair loss, eye abnormalities, loose
stool / diarrhea, and general lethargy / depression are all indicators of ill-health or disease. these conditions can
result from multiple causes including traumatic injury and infectious diseases, or other causes. depending on the
underlying cause, left untreated these conditions may progress leading additional unnecessary animal suffering.
animals exhibiting advanced signs of disease such as generalized lethargy, depression, and weight loss are also at
an increased risk of death when left untreated and several dead animals were found in the above enclosures.
additionally, pre-weaning juvenile animals whose mothers' have died are at significant risk of suffering and or death

affected animals during the inspection and prior to the exit interview.
*** in addition to the animals requiring veterinary care for physical ailments listed above, one roborovski dwarf
hamster exhibiting an abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behavior was identified by inspectors. this tan hamster was
cohoused with 7 other roborovski dwarf hamsters in box 3 of the hallway near room 5 of the main building and was
observed for several minutes during which time it consistently jumped in ""back flip"" motion. the animal would
backflip, run several paces forward into the same starting position and then back flip again, repeating this process
greater than 20 times in a row with little to no deviation to the behavior. the animal continued this behavior even
when other animals in the enclosure walked in its path only making minor alterations as were necessary to continue
the behavior. aphis officials were able to disrupt the behavior by talking or moving the enclosure at which time the
animal burrowed and/or ate a few bites of food, only to return to the stereotypic behavior shortly after. aphis
officials returned to this area to observe the animal again approximately 30 minutes later at which time the animal
was still preforming this abnormal behavior. the facility representative stated that this had not been observed by
the facility previously and no steps had been taken to identify or address the cause. abnormal repetitive behaviors
often called stereotypies are a behavioral indicator of stress and can be detrimental to the animal. all licensees are
required to use appropriate methods to prevent control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries including this type
of behavioral disease. correct by having this animal examined by the attending veterinarian so that appropriate
methods for diagnosis, treatment, and continued monitoring can be taken to identify and correct the cause of the

3391,"** a juvenile female tiger named lilly was injured in its primary enclosure prior to inspection. the injury resulted in a
wound on the inside of the left front leg that required treatment by the attending veterinarian including multiple
sutures and the amputation of one toe. the licensee admitted that the tiger had been in at least two primary
enclosures while on her property. one enclosure, which the licensee stated that the tiger had only been in for a
short time was located between another enclosure housing an adult lion and a second enclosure housing one adult
tiger. the separation between the juvenile and adult tigers while in this enclosure consisted only of wire fencing with
holes approximately 4(cid:29)x4(cid:29). these holes are large enough to allow either the juvenile tiger to reach into the adults or
the adults to reach into the enclosure containing the juvenile which could have resulted in serious injury of the
juvenile tiger. according to the licensee, the tiger was actually injured earlier in the week while housed in the
enclosure known as the (cid:28)peacock house(cid:29) area. she stated that while in that area, its left front paw was caught in
between metal piping used for the framework of the chain-link fencing and the chain-link fence itself. the licensee
stated that she believed the injury resulted from the tiger chewing on its own paw and leg in order to free itself.
according to the attending veterinarian and medical records, the left front leg was torn and a toenail was (cid:28)ripped off(cid:29).
the veterinarian sutured the wounds and provided antibiotics, fluids, and analgesics for the injuries. on inspection,
the juvenile tiger was bright, alert, and responsive. one toe (digit 3) from the left front leg had been amputated and
properly sutured closed, and the inside of the same leg was shaved. there was a 4-5 inch long cut in the shaved
area of the left front leg with multiple sutures along the cut. it is clear from the injuries sustained by this tiger that the
primary enclosure failed to adequately protect it from injury. injuries not only decrease animal welfare, but those that
lead to disfigurement of the paw also may lead to chronic pain. correct this day forward.
**the enclosure housing two adult white tigers had a hole underneath the metal chain link fencing of the primary
enclosure that measured 7 inches in depth and approximately 1 foot across. there is no underground fencing.
holes underneath the primary enclosure fence line can not only result in an escape but also be a danger to the
animal if a foot, leg, or head gets trapped underneath the fence. the licensee said the tigers do dig sometimes and
gravel will be used to fill in the hole at the end of the day. the guillotine door used to permit access to others
sections of the enclosure was determined to be in disrepair and does not protect the two adult white tigers from
potential injury. the clip used to securely keep the metal guillotine door in the open position was broken and the
metal cable attached to the guillotine door was tied to the chain link fencing of the primary enclosure to keep the
door open. one tiger could easily cause the metal cable to become unraveled which could result in injury to the
other tiger. the weight of the metal door could easily cause injury to a foot or tail or possibly cause death in an
animal. there is no counterweight or secondary mechanism to prevent the door from sliding down with full force.
the licensee untied the cable and closed the door. the licensee stated the guillotine door will be left in the down
position until the clip is repaired. stone gravel was used to fill in the hole, and the clip for the guillotine door had
been replaced at time of exit. continue to ensure primary enclosures are in good repair and protect the animals
from possible injuries.
**the enclosure of a young male kangaroo does not protect the animal from injury. there is a black electric cord
used to provide heat that is in reach of the kangaroo. electric cords in reach of an animal represent both a risk of
entanglement and an electrical hazard which can cause burns or electrocution if the cord is chewed on. additionally,
a wooden door on the inside of the enclosure is in disrepair and has sharp edges. the door has a missing wood
plank, but the nails used to attach the plank are still present. these nails protrude out approximately 1 inch and are
at the level of the animal. the nails and deteriorating, splintering wood are sharp objects in the enclosure that could
cause injury to an animal. the electric cord was fixed in a higher position, and the nails in the door had been bent
down to eliminate sharp protrusions. the wood of the door is still splintered and is slated to be replaced according
to the licensee. correct by 12/13/2014.
** the enclosure with one adult fox has an area where feet could go through chain link fencing. the fox enclosure
has chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, as water has been
dumped (daily) for cleaning purposes it has eroded the soil underneath the water bucket and surrounding area. the
eroded soil has created an area approximately 3 square feet surrounding the water bowl in which the foxes(cid:25) feet
easily pass through the chain link fencing to stand on the ground below. since this area in surrounding the water
bowl, animals must walk over this area frequently in order to access water. feet or legs can become injured if an
animal becomes entangled in the chain link fencing. stone gravel was placed to fill in the hole underneath the
fencing at the time of exit. correct by 12/10/2014.
**the plastic white igloo used in the young male grizzly bear(cid:25)s enclosure as a den is in disrepair. the entrance in
the igloo has been significantly chewed on and a 3 inch piece has been broken off at the entranceway. objects in
the primary enclosure that are in disrepair are unable to be properly cleaned and may serve as a route to spread
infection to the bear in the enclosure. correct by 12/25/2014.
**in the field comprising part of the primary enclosure for one donkey, 8 goats, and one sheep there is an
approximately 5 inch diameter white plastic pipe sticking out of the ground near a fence line that contains several
animals on the other side . the pipe has a jagged edge and rose approximately 6-7 inches out of the ground.
animals were seen walking in the area of the pipe and the donkey was observed repeatedly running in this area as
it interacted with animals on the other side of the fence. the licensee stated the pipe was a clean out port for
drainage. as it is currently situated this pipe is a hazard to the animals in the enclosure. a foot could easily become
trapped or cut by the pipe and cause serious injury. correct by 12/22/2014.
the licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals."

while the handlers are in free contact. due to weather on the day of inspection, only a limited interaction between
dogs and elephants could be observed by aphis officials. the manager was asked to demonstrate an example of
this type of interaction, and so he called one of the dogs to create a barrier between the husbandry staff and an
elephant which had reached its trunk through the enclosure bars. the dog showed aggressive behavior, growling
and lunging at one elephant and entering its enclosure before being called by the manager. the manager also
reported the dogs' having bitten the elephants during the course of their work. furthermore, a cbs news clip from
may 13, 2014, which was verified by the facility representatives, showed the elephants exhibiting signs of distress
when charged by one of the dogs, including ear flapping, trumpeting, and turning and running away. the manager
was clear that the dogs are not herding the elephants but are protecting the keepers during free contact. having the
dogs interact with the elephants by unrestrained lunging and biting may cause undue stress to the elephants. all

of time. it was observed at the beginning of the inspection and several hours later at the end of the inspection, the
cubs were observed sucking again. the one cubs ear was soaked and there was indication of hair loss on the ear.
the facility stated that all of their hand reared cubs do this behavior and they were not concerned with it. this is an
abnormal behavior pattern that can be attributed to stress and how the cubs cope with stress. additionally the
constant sucking of the paw and ear can cause physical hot spots or potential ear infection. the facility did not

3681,"the facility received a male indian rhino (id# 121021) last fall. the rhino was housed all winter in the rhino barn adjacent
to the females. he was then introduced to the females in a smaller pasture prior to the group moving to the large pasture
on may 11, 2022 where the herd of one male and two females bactrian camels lived. the male rhino lived in the pasture
without incident as reported by the facility for two weeks, when they came in to find the male bactrian camel (id# 109040)
dead on may 25, 2022. pathology report indicated a 4 cm laceration on ventral right neck at thoracic inlet, tearing of
multiple large veins, and death due to suspected exsanguination from this laceration.
indian male rhinos become aggressive during a premating phase of breeding.
while another male rhino may understand the social cues and have methods to submit, avoid or evade a dominant male
in breeding, a male from another species (such as the male bactrian camel) may not. male bactrian camels can also be
highly aggressive and dominant when they are in rut which is documented march-april. male bactrian camels rely on
social cues to deter competitors. in the wild, the home ranges of these two species do not overlap, therefore, they may be
unlikely to understand normal species specific social cues which have evolved to prevent conflict. additionally, this rhino
had previously not lived with a camel, again, making it unlikely they would understand social cues. as these are two very
different species of ungulates, their social and behavioral cues do not coincide, and the camel did not have an effective
manner to evade the male rhino and so the injury was likely caused by the rhino.
*** records indicated that during 2021 and 2022, at least 5 male deer approximately 6-8 years of age were found dead
from causes resulting from traumatic injuries as indicated in pathology reports. these deaths included:
- male bactrian deer id# 114090: this 7-year-old male was found dead in the water of a pond on 9/18/2021 and had no
prior medical concerns. necropsy showed 30-50 liters of blood in the pleural cavity (around the lungs), clotted blood within
the lungs, rhabdomyolysis and edema of the muscles, and hemorrhage and swelling within the spinal cord. the cause of
death was attributed to exertional myopathy and trauma.
- male bactrian deer id# 114050: this 7-year-old male was euthanized on 10/11/2021 after being found severely injured.
necropsy findings showed that there was a deep puncture wound to the right lateral chest which penetrated the chest
cavity, a partial rupture of the attachment of the triceps including a torn muscle, hemorrhage into the chest cavity and
pericardia! sac (around the heart). these findings are consistent with severe traumatic injury.
- male pere david's deer id# 114016: this 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/2021. the prior day he
was in rut and observed chasing other males in the same enclosure. necropsy showed swelling, bruising, and necrotic
tissue in the neck and hemorrhage in the lungs and heart.
male pere david's deer id# 113030: this 8-year-old male was found dead 7/6/2021. the prior day he was noted to have
appeared bright, alert, and reactive. it was noted that this was during the breeding season when males are in rut.
necropsy results showed a puncture wound to the right lower neck with significant areas of bruising, hemorrhage, and
subcutaneous emphysema (accumulation of air under the skin) in the shoulder, neck, face, and large areas in the right
chest. the jugular vein had been lacerated and there were areas of hemorrhage in the lungs. death was attributed to
trauma.
-male pere david's deer id# 116008: this 6-year-old male was found in a lake in the pasture on 6/29/2022. necropsy
results showed extensive bruising and hemorrhage over the left face, neck, shoulder, and chest, hemorrhage into the
chest cavity, 500-800 ml of hemorrhagic pericardia! effusion (around the heart), broken incisors and lacerations to the
lower lip, and little to no food in the gastrointestinal system. the cause of death was not definitive though findings showed
both trauma and anorexia, insufficient food consumption.
male sichuan takin id# 115006: this 7-year-old male was found dead in the pasture on 6/23/22. necropsy results
showed a large wound to the lower abdomen with a penetrating puncture into the abdominal cavity. there was severe
cellulitis and hemorrhage around the puncture site and approximately a foot of intestine entrapped.
currently the facility maintains herds of bactrian deer (30 males and 38 females), a bachelor herd of 16 bactrian deer,
pere david's deer {21 males and 51 females) and takin (23 males to 26 females). these groups of animals are housed
in similar large open pastures with varying topographic features. both deer species are known to enter a breeding period
seasonally known as ""rut"" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females.
while establishing dominance during rut, both species are known to fight and left unchecked these fights can lead to
traumatic injuries and death. fighting can also occur at other times of the year as dominant males fight to guard feeding
areas or other preferred areas of pastures. the facility states that the area is large enough for the animals to avoid or
escape from each other and there is variable terrain with the hills, however there are limited visual barriers within most
pastures.
additionally, there may be no easy access to alternate pastures for subordinate males to retreat to after dominance is
established which would allow them to evade or avoid now dominant established males who are actively breeding
females. access to different pastures is managed by the facility at their discretion.
the facility confirmed that the deaths of hoof stock in the 2021 and 2022 were typical and consistent with observations
from prior years. facility staff must ensure that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and
intervene to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises. the inclusion of visual barriers and/or safe retreat
areas for subordinate males may help increase compatibility during times of the year when breeding behaviors are
expected to increase competition between adult males, however, close observation of animals and intervention is
necessary to ensure that animals are not housed with or near other animals that interfere with their health or cause them
discomfort and/or death.
failure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary
suffering, and death. correct no later than 9/20/22 by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are
compatible and that they do not interfere with the heath of other animals and/or cause discomfort.

3682,"since september 2022 two adult male sichuan takin have died as a result of injuries consistent with traumatic wounds
consistent with fighting. this includes:
* takin male (10 years old) id # 112003 was on exhibit sept 5, 2022 in pasture d when staff observed he was 3-legged
lame. this animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the attending veterinarian. upon exam he was in
good body condition but had a rf comminuted fracture of humerus. due to extent of injuries, he was humanely
euthanized. pathology reports confirmed the fracture of the distal humerus and cubital joint as well as extensive bruising
of the surrounding area. medical records indicated that this takin also had swelling of the left eye on aug 4, 2022 which
was suspected to be due to trauma (though a primary ocular cause was not able to be ruled out). although this individual
was described by the facility staff as the primary breeding male takin for many years. records indicate that as of august
2022 another male takin was showing dominant behavior.
* takin male (8 years old) id # 114007 was on exhibit nov 7, 2022 in pasture d when staff reported the animal appeared
lethargic and had lost body condition. animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the attending
veterinarian who found a deep puncture wound on left caudal abdomen and suspected septicemia. this takin was
euthanized due to guarded prognosis and on necropsy the wound was further explored. on necropsy it was determined
that this wound extended 20 cm in several directions and while it did not connect with the body cavity adhesions and scar
tissue indicated that it likely did previously. this same animal had an abscess of the left shoulder in november of 2020
that is also consistent with prior fighting. this takin was appropriately treated and recovered at that time.
currently the facility maintains a large herd of takin which is composed of approximately 20 males to 25 females. this
group of animals is housed in an open pasture that is approximately 100 acres, is shared with other species, and has
varying topographic features. wild takin originate from asia where they inhabit rocky terrain, dense forest, and alpine
areas. they usually are found in large social groups with females and offspring making up 98% of the herd. both males
and females have their own dominance hierarchy structure. mature males enter a breeding period seasonally known as
""rut"" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females. non-dominant adult males are
typically not found living with breeding groups and tend to be more solitary. during rut, young mature males may
challenge the dominant male fighting for access to breeding females but typically the loosing male will not remain with the
herd after such a challenge.
during the inspection facility staff described that they typically have one primary breeding male and a small number of
other males which may breed with fewer females. the facility currently maintains too many male takin in the breeding
enclosure/pasture and continues to have animals injured as a result of the lack of separation. as of december 2022,
there is no separate area (or bachelor group) of non-dominant male takin. the number and concentration of mature male
animals is likely leads to an increased number of challenges to the dominant breeding male(s) by other mature
subordinate males that are housed within the same area. additionally, this concentration of males also likely leads to
increased sparring and conflict between subordinate males as well. although sparring and fighting or access to breeding
females is a normal behavioral pattern in wild takin, the traumatic injuries which lead to the deaths of these animals
indicate that the co-housed animals are causing injury and discomfort. given the number of co-housed males, the
dominant male and his females also cannot easily move away from challengers and are left in a position to have to
constantly fight challenging males during breeding season while also actively breeding females which can leave the
dominant male exhausted, causing discomfort and interfering with his health. having this many intact breeding males in
one group with the breeding females is currently interfering with the compatibility of the herd. the facility still does not
have a plan in place to be able to separate the established dominant male takin and females from subordinate males to
reduce these conflicts which are causing traumatic injuries to various animals.
failure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary
suffering, and death. correct by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and
ensuring through daily observation that staff intervenes to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises.

and remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. the facility offered a video
recording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. in this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four
limbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. on july 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with
his mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our
observation. the facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had
showed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. he had a
roughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the
animal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. the documented diet for this animal includes
7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with platinum performance: exotic wellness and
performance formula. during conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the
bones within the meat fed. this current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the
growing animal. upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was
heavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. after speaking with the
veterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on
may 4, 2015. in the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and
antihistamine therapy. she completed a second visual assessment on june 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss
and recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. on the second visual
assessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were dandy-walker syndrome, vestibular disease or
incomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. according to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored
because the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. the failure to understand that
young, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and
veterinary care. metabolic bone disease is a common disease of young big cats. this disease stems from
inadequate levels of calcium in the diet. during early development the animal will need an increased level of
calcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. at the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the
proper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. the deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused
this animal severe animal welfare concerns. the length in time to get diagnostic information about the lion(cid:25)'s
condition and the lack of attention to investigate the nutritional value of the lion(cid:25)'s diet illustrate that appropriate
methods were not taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. correct by, (1) providing a fully nutritious and
wholesome diet, (2) having an experienced and knowledgeable veterinarian examine, diagnostic, and treat the lion,
(3) have a written treatment plan available for inspection. correct by 6 p.m.7/17/15. at the time of exit interview, the
facility has started putting calcium supplements in the food, but has not developed a treatment program for the
animal. thor was transported to another u.s.d.a licensed facility on 7/17/15.
***a female timber wolf was observed to have irritated areas on the external margins of both of her ears.
approximately one inch along the edges and back of the ears is both thickened, crusted over and had several spots
where blood is apparent. the affected areas are missing hair and the underlying skin is black to grey in color. these
changes are commonly associated with chronic injury to the skin. the problem was exacerbated by the flies which
were noted to be on the affected areas causing the wolf to shake her head and rub her ears on the rocks and
vegetation within the enclosure. the facility representative indicated that the areas were being treated using
fly-spray to decrease irritation and prevent future rubbing and scratching of the area. however; during the
inspection, the facility was not able to produce any documentation to support a proper diagnosis or treatment has
been made by the attending veterinarian. after discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that
approximately one month prior to inspection the facility had been consulted to treat the timber wolves for a heavy
mite infestation. this infestation had become recurrent in warmer weathers and the veterinarian had documented
the need for multiple treatments. correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.
***an adult female patas monkey was noted to be non-weight bearing on the front left limb. the left shoulder and
arm had moderate muscle loss. the facility indicated that the animal had been treated by a veterinarian and
diagnosed with an elbow injury. the animal was put into a cast and prescribed pain management at the time of
injury. after the cast was removed no further pain management was provided. a veterinarian has not been
consulted for further assessment or treatment of this animal'(cid:25)s condition and no documentation was provided to
support any form of diagnosis or treatment. after discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that
the animal was under the care and custody of the veterinarian at the time of the arm injury. the animal was being
treated at the veterinary clinic for heavy fenbendazole resistant parasite infestation. during restraint of the animal for
treatment, the arm was fractured. during the attending veterinarian visit on july 15, 2015 further deworming of the
animal and suggested enrichment based physical therapy to increase the functionality of the arm. correct by having
the animal evaluated by a knowledgeable, licensed veterinarian, developing a long-term treatment plan, and
monitoring the animal(cid:25)'s development over time. correct by 7/17/15 by 6 p.m.
***an adult llama in the camelid enclosure was observed to have a white opacity in the left eye. when asked, the
facility representative had not noticed the issue or started any treatment with the eye. the opacity in the eye of the
llama could cause unnecessary discomfort, blindness or a secondary infection. this abnormality could be
secondary to an underlying condition with the eye or secondary age related change. after the attending
veterinarian examined the animal it was determined that the injury was an old corneal scar. she determined no
treatment was needed at this time and the prognosis of the animal was good. correct by documenting the
veterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation of the abnormality. correct by 7/17/15.
***an adult male aoudad was noted to have a subcutaneous mass over his left shoulder. the mass did not appear
to cause the animal immediate discomfort and did not appear to be impacting or limiting his mobility. when asked,
the facility representative indicated that the mass was caused by an old injury that had been previously discussed
with the veterinarian. records were not provided for the facility documenting that the issue had been addressed by
the veterinarian. after discussion with the attending veterinarian the injury was confirmed. the veterinarian
indicated that the injury had abscessed and had ruptured prior to her observation. the injury may have
re-abscessed, leading to the mass appearance on the animal'(cid:25)s side. after a second examination by the attending
veterinarian on july 15, 2015 it was determined that the wound had re-abscessed and encapsulated. the mass
would have to be removed to properly heal the injury. the mass on the adult aoudad could be a sign of secondary
infection or other disease which could lead to pain or distress for the animal. this mass should be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian and a treatment plan created to ensure the animal(cid:25)s well-being. correct by 7/20/15.
the veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to secondary
disease or worsening of the original condition. a licensed and knowledgeable veterinarian must be consulted to
evaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues. it is the facilities responsibility to ensure that
documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment is maintained and made available for review by aphis
officials. the veterinary care items described here have significant impact to animal welfare and may lead to

consulted to evaluate, diagnose, and treat the current veterinary care issues."
4034,"on march 9, 2015 during an examination and treatment of the adult female patas monkey, sera, for a parasitic
infection (whipworm, roundworm and baylisascaris) the animal'(cid:25)s arm was fractured. the animal was under full care
and custody of the attending veterinarian at the time of the incident. this incident happened at the attending
veterinarian'(cid:25)s clinic. the animal was deemed to be an inappropriate anesthetic candidate due to age and poor
health condition at the time of the diagnosis and initiation of treatment. during the restraint of the animal by the
attending veterinarian and her staff the animal'(cid:25)s arm was fractured. the veterinarian placed the animal(cid:25)'s arm in a
sling and gave it initial pain management. the animal had a parasitic infection and was treated. her condition was
stabilized before returning to the facility. the animal received no further pain management and there were no
records of the rehabilitation plan or any further assessments by the attending veterinarian. at the time of the
inspection the animal continued to have very limited use of the arm and there was a moderate atrophy of the muscle
in the arm and shoulder. inappropriate handling of the animal has caused harm and unnecessary pain and distress.
handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. correct by 7/17/15."
4046,"the enclosure housing the several camelids failed to provide adequate protection from inclement weather observed
on 7/13/2015. during the inspection the animals in this enclosure were huddled under the barn in an attempt to
escape the heavy rains. the space provided under the roof was not large enough to provide enough shelter and or
protection from the rain for all of the animals within the enclosure. the animals exposed to the inclement weather
were seen making several attempts to find shelter in the limited available space. several of the animals were
observed laying in areas that were wet or area where they were directly being rained on. exposure to inclement
weather increases the risk of respiratory illness or several other illnesses that can directly affect the animal'(cid:25)s health
and well-being. the limited space during inclement weather also causes discomfort for the animals. an adequate
amount of natural or artificial shelter must be provided for all animals at all times while being housed in outdoor
enclosures. correct by 7/30/15."

4063,"the two largest goat pens do not have adequate shade for all animals within the enclosure. ten goats are occupying one
large pen because the shelter structure was compromised in their second pen. in the currently occupied pen, there are
two shade structures, each one capable of about three goats fitting under at one time. due to the larger number of
animals and limited shade structures in the functional enclosure, there is not enough shelter from direct sunlight available
to all animals. animals require shelter from direct sunlight in order to regulate their body temperature and avoid heat
stress or stroke. correct by 12 july 2022 by ensuring all animals have access to shade from direct sunlight.

under so that it no longer provides full protection from the sun. the animals do have access to their den at all times
and can get out of the sun there, however, the temperature inside the den on the day of inspection was 3 degrees
warmer than the outside temperature. for their comfort and well being, enough shade in addition to the den space
must be provided on warm days, so that both bears can get out of the direct sunlight at the same time. correct by
6/30/14."
4073,"thirty five individual animals were identified by aphis officials in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection.
the licensee stated that he has been raising these animals for so long that many injuries and illnesses are treated
by the facility without calling a veterinarian. he further stated that they are in frequent contact with their attending
veterinarian and his partner (also another licensed veterinarian), however, they do not currently maintain written
records of treatments. at the start of the inspection the wife of the licensee (responsible for much of the daily care
for animals) stated that there were no animals currently receiving veterinary treatment. when asked about animals
that recently received treatment, she stated only a serval had been recently treated. the wife of the licensee stated
that she does keep some short notes in a personal journal, but that this was not available for inspection as it was
mixed with other personal information. when asked, the wife of the licensee did re-copy a list of animals reportedly
treated by the facility during the period of 20 october 2014 through 6 january 2015. these notes were reviewed in
determining compliance with this section.
*** direct: two oryx had significant lameness at the time of inspection. this included:
- oryx #1: a juvenile (still nursing) oryx was significantly lame on the right front leg at the time of inspection.
this animal was observed alternately toe-touching lame and non-weight bearing lame when moving at a walk on 6
january 2015. on 8 january 2015 this animal was observed consistently non-weight bearing even when running
and did not bear any weight on the limb at any point during observations that day. on 6 january, the licensee
stated that the facility first observed this lameness approximately 3-4 days prior to the start of the inspection.
- oryx #2: a young adult oryx was significantly lame on the left front leg at the time of inspection. this animal
was observed consistently toe-touching lame when moving at a walk (both on 6 & 8 january 2015). the licensee
stated that the facility first observed this lameness approximately 6-7 days prior to the start of the inspection.
following identification of these animals to the licensee (on 6 january), the licensee stated that oryx will
occasionally be lame as a result of sparring and also frequently become lame during the winter when the ground is
frozen. he stated that this typically resolves with time and that it is too stressful to the animal to remove it from the
herd for examination since it may not be accepted back into the herd. although the licensee stated that he had not
contacted the attending veterinarian (av) for advice regarding veterinary treatment for either of these oryx, he also
stated that he had previously discussed the issue of lameness in oryx generally with the partner of the av (also
another licensed veterinarian). the licensee stated as long as there is not a compound fracture, the animal should
not be removed from the herd for further evaluation and treatment regarding lameness since it may just be a sprain
or similar minor injury. there was no record of any previous advice from any veterinarian and no written guidance
present in the program of veterinary care for lameness in oryx or any other species. no veterinary care was
provided to either oryx listed above. lameness is a significant indicator of pain and failure to provide appropriate
methods to properly diagnose and treat the underlying cause in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain
and suffering. correct by having these animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and following all
recommendations including those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment, and future recheck examinations as
needed. additionally, the licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by aphis
officials. if this is a recurrent problem the licensee may seek additional guidance from the attending veterinarian
for incorporation into the written program of veterinary care regarding recommendations for any future animals that
may develop lameness. this was first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015.
*** direct: several guinea pigs (gp) were exhibiting varying amounts of hair loss at the time of inspection. tubs
1& 2 were located on the patio outside the keeper area. tub 3 was located in the storage trailer near the mouse
house.
- gp#1: a black and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 1 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its
nose stretching 2/3 of the way to its eye. the underlying skin in this area was dry, crusty, and had several dark
spots that appeared to be scabs. additionally, there was a small amount of crusted skin under the right eye. this
was first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2014.
- gp#2: a black and white adult guinea pig located in tub 1 had several small areas of hair loss on the left side
of its nose. the underlying skin was dry, flaky, and had several dark spots that appeared to be scabs. this was
first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2014.
- gp#3: a tan and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had several small areas of hair loss on the right side
of its face near its eye, on the top of its head, and at the base of the right ear. the underlying skin was dry and in
the area on top of the head it was flaky and had dark spots that appeared to be scabs. this was first identified to
the licensee on 6 january 2014.
- gp#4: a brown juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its nose
extending from the nose to the right eye and over the bridge of the nose. the underlying skin in this area was dry,
crusty, and had numerous spots of medium and dark red areas that appeared to be scabs. this was first identified
to the licensee on 6 january 2014.
- gp#5: a brown and white guinea pig located in tub 2 had a small area of hair loss on the bridge of the nose.
the underlying skin was dry and without significant crusts or flakes. this was first identified to the licensee on 6
january 2014.
- gp#6: a tan guinea pig with a white stripe between its eyes located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss on the
bridge of the nose. the underlying skin is dry, flaky, and has one dark spot that appeared to be a scab. this was
first identified to the licensee on 7 january 2014.
- gp#7: a brown and white guinea pig located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss extending between the left eye
and ear. the underlying skin is dry and flaky. this was first identified to the licensee on 7 january 2014.
- gp#8: a black and white guinea pig located in tub 3 has an area of hair loss and irregular skin just above its
right eye and a second spot just behind the nose on the right side. the skin surrounding the eye appears dry,
thickened, and leathery while the area near the nose is dry and flaky. this was first identified to the licensee on 7
january 2014.
- gp#9: a brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has a focal area of incomplete hair loss on
the bridge of its nose. the underlying skin is dry and flaky. this was first identified to the licensee on 7 january
2014.
- gp#10: a brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has areas of hair loss on the top of the
head and under the left ear. the underlying skin in both areas is dry and crusty. this was first identified to the
licensee on 7 january 2014.
all of the guinea pigs listed above appeared bright, alert, and reactive. none were observed actively scratching at
the affected areas, however, the dark spots present on several animals appear to be scabs and dried blood and are
consistent with scratching as a result of itchiness. these conditions were not reported to the attending veterinarian
prior to inspection and none of these animals were receiving any treatment for these conditions. hair loss can result
from numerous causes including several infectious causes such as fungal and bacterial diseases. given the
number of animals with similar lesions, the cause is likely to be infectious. when the attending veterinarian
observed these animals, on 8 january 2015, he stated that the lesions were suspicious for ringworm and would
make a diagnostic / treatment plan accordingly. infectious skin disorders may be transmitted to other uninfected
animals in the same enclosure or enclosures nearby. numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with
affected animals in each tub listed above. the licensee stated that he had not contacted the attending veterinarian
regarding these issues prior to the start of the inspection and there were no methods in place to prevent spread of
this condition. there was no previous guidance from the attending veterinarian for skin disorders in guinea pigs and
no written guidance in the program of veterinary care. correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin
abnormalities are examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and
a proper diagnosis can be made. additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian
regarding appropriate treatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in the
guinea pig colony. records of these recommendations must be maintained for evaluation by aphis officials.
*** three camels located in the camel exhibit area in the main zoo location showed signs of abnormal skin
conditions. these were identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015.
- camel #1: a female camel had a significant swelling (at least 7 inches by 3 inches) located on the right side at
the base of the hump. additionally, there is a large area of dark discharge (brown, red, and black) extending from
the swelling down the right side to the abdomen. this discharge appears dried and caked in the fur.
- camel #2: a female camel had a significant swelling on the left shoulder area (approximately 3 inches and
roughly circular). the skin overlying this area is hairless and there is dried red-brown material caked in the fur
surrounding the lesion. this camel was later identified by the facility as ""(cid:28)lauren""(cid:29).
- camel #3: a female camel (with an ear tag #5) had a swelling on the right mid-neck. there was a brown-red
discharge caked in the surrounding fur.
when asked about these lesions, the licensee stated that they are abscesses and that they occur regularly in the
camels. he stated that they are treated by the facility staff (typically his wife) whenever they are observed. he
further stated that typically they would not call the attending veterinarian for these issues since they are a common
occurrence and they have been treating them for years. when asked, the wife of the licensee stated that she had
cleaned the abscess on (cid:28)""lauren""(cid:29) prior to the inspection (on 3 january 2015) by flushing it with diluted iodine and
spraying it with wound spray. there is currently no written guidance in the program of veterinary care which would
allow treatment by the facility without consultation from the attending veterinarian. abscesses are often caused by
infectious agents and there are 5 additional camels located in this pasture and 1 housed so that it is sharing the
same barn (with direct contact). there were no methods currently in use to stop the spread of disease if it is
transmissible between animals. correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are
examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis
can be made. additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding appropriate
treatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in the camels. the licensee
must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by aphis officials.
*** the male cougar has an area on the right hind leg where the skin appears reddened and moist. the area is
approximately 2 inches wide by 4 inches long and is located on the back of the leg behind the right knee. this was
identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015 and at that time the licensee stated that he was unaware of this
condition. it was identified to the wife of the licensee on 7 january 2015 and she also stated she was unaware of
the condition but would make sure the attending veterinarian was called to examine it. skin disease can result from
numerous infectious and non-infectious causes. left untreated, it may progress resulting in unnecessary discomfort
or suffering. correct by ensuring that this animal is examined by a licensed veterinarian for recommendations
regarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment. the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and
recommendations for evaluation by aphis officials.
*** one female giraffe had hooves which were overgrown and a slightly abnormal gait when compared to the other
giraffes at the facility. when asked about routine giraffe hoof care the licensee stated that the giraffe will naturally
wear their hooves down in the yard since there is gravel present in the giraffe enclosure. this individual giraffe was
identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015 at which time the licensee stated that he was not sure of the individual
animal(cid:25)'s name although he thought it may be vivian. when the animal with long hooves was pointed out, the
licensee assured inspectors that the hooves would wear to a normal length over time if left on the gravel. the
licensee further assured the inspectors that if that did not happen he would be able to transport the giraffe to north
carolina when the weather warms to trim her hooves using a chute at another usda licensee(cid:25)'s facility.
additionally, he stated that they were in the process of constructing a giraffe chute to facilitate easier handling of the
giraffe and make hoof trimming easier in the future. there was no documentation at the facility that the licensee
has guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding the treatment of overgrown hooves in giraffe. inspectors
did observe a partially constructed chute. excessively long hooves can progress causing abnormal gaits,
lameness, unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animal. correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate treatment for this condition. if transportation
of this animal is necessary for treatment, this guidance should include an appropriate timeline for providing this
care. additionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by
aphis officials. this was first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2014.
*** numerous capuchin monkeys had hair loss to varying degrees and were observed scratching during the
inspection. this included:
- capuchin #1: a brown (tufted) capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss over its
entire back extending over its sides and shoulders. additionally there was a smaller area of hair loss on its tail. the
underlying skin appeared dry. this capuchin was housed with two other monkeys (one of which is capuchin #2
listed below). this animal was observed scratching during the inspection.
- capuchin #2: a brown (tufted) capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss along the
length of its tail (worst at the tip) as well as hair thinning over the rump area and back. this animal was periodically
observed scratching during the course of the inspection. this capuchin was housed with two other monkeys
including capuchin #1 listed above).
- capuchin #3: a white-faced capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house
building (co-housed with 5 other capuchin monkeys including capuchin #4 below) had generalized patchy hair loss
(over the back, hind legs, tail, etc.). this animal was observed scratching.
- capuchin #4: a white-faced capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house
building (co-housed with 5 other capuchin monkeys including capuchin #3 above) had incomplete hair loss located
along the length of the tail and its left knee.
- capuchin #5: a white-faced capuchin monkey missing part of the left index finger located in the back room of
the mouse-house building had hair loss on both forearms and on the tail. the capuchin was observed vigorously
scratching at times during the inspection. this capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#6 and 7 below) and in a
room with two other groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of debrazza'(cid:25)s monkeys.
- capuchin #6: a white-faced capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
patchy hair loss on the tail. this capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 7) and in a room with two other
groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of debrazza(cid:25)'s monkeys.
- capuchin #7: a white-faced capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
patchy hair loss on the tail. this capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 6 above) and in a room with two
other groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of debrazza(cid:25)'s monkeys.
- capuchin #8: a brown (tufted) capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
extensive hair loss on its tail and several small patches on its back. this animal was observed vigorously
scratching at times during the inspection. this capuchin was co-housed with 2 other non-affected animals and in a
room with two other groups of capuchins and a group of debrazza(cid:25)'s monkeys.
the hair loss in capuchins #1 & 2 were first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2014. capuchins #3 - 8 were
first identified to the licensee on 7 january 2014. there was no written documentation regarding the treatment of
these animals for hair loss and the attending veterinarian stated to aphis officials that he would generally refer
primates to another local veterinarian for treatment. hair loss associated with apparent discomfort (evidenced by
scratching) can result from a number of causes including several infectious causes. left untreated these conditions
may result in worsening of the condition, development of secondary infections, and unnecessary suffering. when
skin disorders are resulting from an infectious cause, they may be transmitted to other uninfected animals in the
same enclosure or enclosures nearby. numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with affected
animals in nearby enclosures. correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are examined
by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis can be
made. the licensee must follow all recommendations by the veterinarian including those regarding diagnosis,
treatment, prevention, control of this condition, and recheck examinations. records of these findings, treatment,
and future recommendations must be kept for evaluation by aphis officials.
*** a small mandrill housed with the adult male mandrill had hair loss over top aspect of both forearms. on the right
arm the hair loss extends from the elbow to hand and on the left arm it extends over a smaller portion of the arm.
the underlying skin appears dry. this was first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015 at which time he stated
that this is probably due to stress because the female mandrill in the adjacent enclosure (with limited tactile contact)
picks on and intimidates this animal. he stated that the female is a full-sister to this affected animal and that
negative interaction is the reason they are separated. he stated that this issue has not been evaluated by a
veterinarian and there was no record that the facility had contacted the attending veterinarian for any evaluation.
there was no direction in the written program of veterinary care or the non-human primate enrichment plan to
address hair loss or hair plucking in primates. while hair loss in this area of primates often has an underlying
behavioral cause, guidance from the attending veterinarian must be sought to ensure appropriate diagnosis and
treatment and to prevent worsening of the condition. correct by contacting the attending veterinarian and following
all recommendations including his direction regarding the diagnosis, care, and treatment. additionally, the
enrichment plan should be amended to address non-medical causes of hair plucking in primates if the veterinarian
believes this to be an issue at the facility.
***a black and white pygmy goat located in the main zoo area has a creamy white vulvar discharge, crusted
discharge dried on the vulva, hair loss on flanks, and significant crusts around its nose. the end of the tail also has
a moderate amount of dried dark debris caked in the hair which appears to be contamination from the discharge
mixed with dirt. the goat was bright, alert, and active and ate a small amount of grain during the inspection. the
abnormalities were initially observed by aphis officials on 6 january 2015 and continued to be present on multiple
days during the inspection process. when asked about this goat, the wife of the licensee stated that this was an
older goat and that she looks ok. there was no record to indicate that the facility had contacted the attending
veterinarian about this animal and she was not on any treatment at the start of the inspection. this was first
identified to the wife of the licensee on 6 january 2015. correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment for this condition.
additionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by aphis
officials.
*** all of the muntjac in the enclosure between the macaques and african crested porcupine (total of 6) had fur over
their rump area that was ruffled and standing on end. two of these animals (one male and one female) had a large
amount of dark brown material under their tails consistent with caked on diarrhea. diarrhea can be an indicator of
ill-health and can have many causes both infectious (parasites, bacterial disease, etc.) or non-infectious (problems
with diet, individual metabolic disease, etc). ruffled hair in the area of the rump can be an indicator of several
problems such as skin disease or more generalized systemic problems. failure to properly diagnose and treat this
condition may result in the worsening of the condition and possibly spread of disease between animals (if the
underlying cause is infectious). there was no documentation that the facility has contacted the attending
veterinarian regarding these animals. correct by having these animals examined by the attending veterinarian and
following all recommendations regarding diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of this condition. additionally
the licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by aphis officials. this was first
identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015.
*** a tan and white llama located in the llama paddock in the main zoo has a mass under the jaw on the left side
that has crusty debris overlying this mass. this animal appeared bright and alert. there was no documentation
that the facility contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal. masses in this area can result from numerous
conditions both infectious and non-infectious (such as tooth root abscess, neoplasia, etc). failure to properly
diagnose and treat this condition can result in disease progression and lead to unnecessary suffering. correct by
having this animal examined by the attending veterinarian and following all recommendations. additionally the
licensee must maintain record of these findings and recommendations for evaluation by aphis officials. this was
first identified to the licensee on 6 january 2015.
*** a miniature zebu steer located in the petting area of the main zoo had long misshapen claws on both hind legs
with the right more affected than the left. the outer claw of the right rear foot appears to be partially twisted under
the foot so that the steer is partially weight bearing on the outer wall. the zebu did not appear to be lame at a walk.
the wife of the licensee stated that this was an older steer and that he has always had bad feet as did his father.
she also stated that the facility uses a good farrier to trim hooves, that he had trimmed the feet for this zebu in
december, and that these are about as good as they normally look. there was no written documentation of any
prior hoof trims. left untreated, long or misshapen hooves can progress and cause lameness, abnormal stress on
the joints, and discomfort to the animal. while there was no record of recent farrier care, if this animal(cid:25)'s feet were
trimmed in december, there is an increased reason to contact the attending veterinarian (av) for recommendations
about whether additional treatment is necessary. correct by contacting the av and following all recommendations
regarding treatment and future monitoring of this animal. additionally the licensee must maintain records of these
recommendations for evaluation by aphis officials. this was first identified to the wife of the licensee on 6 january
2015.
each dealer and exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care to include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. adequate records of veterinary
care (including all treatments provided by the facility and communication of issues of health to the attending
veterinarian) are an integral part of an adequate program of veterinary care since they are necessary to ensure
communication between facility staff as well as between the facility and the attending veterinarian when animals are
exhibiting signs of medical problems or have a history of previous problems. failure of the facility to establish and
maintain an adequate program of veterinary care (including record keeping) can result in delayed veterinary
treatment and prevent the attending veterinarian from making accurate diagnoses. correct by ensuring that all
animals showing signs of injury, disease, or illness are promptly examined by a licensed veterinarian and
maintaining adequate records from this point forward.
all animals requiring veterinary treatment identified by aphis officials were communicated to the licensee as they
were identified. additionally, aphis officials discussed a comprehensive list of animals requiring care at the
conclusion of 7 january 2015 with both the licensee and his wife. this discussion included both the necessary
corrective action and a timeline for correction (given to the licensee as noon on friday 10 january 2015)."
4082,"adult guinea pigs with their litters were housed in oval metal stock water troughs that measured 31.5 inches wide in
the mid-section by 92 inches long with curved ends (decreasing the interior space of the enclosure). the area of
each oval metal stock water trough was 1905.75 square inches (60.5x31.5) plus 778.9 square inches
(3.14x(15.75x15.75)) to equal 2684 square inches. each trough had 2 eight inch diameter water bowls that took up
100.5 square inches of floor space (2x3.14x(4x4)) and 2 ten inch diameter food dishes that took up 157 square
inches of floor space (2x3.14x(5x5)). the floor area for the guinea pigs in each of the metal troughs was
approximately 2428 square inches when the area of the bowls/dishes was subtracted (2684-(100.5+157)).
each adult guinea pig and nursing female with her litter requires at least 101 square inches of floor space so each
tub can house a maximum of 24 of these guinea pigs. weaned guinea pigs weighing less than 350 grams require
at least 60 square inches of floor space so when weaned guinea pigs are also housed with the adult guinea pigs
then less adult guinea pigs can be housed in the metal troughs. while inspecting the guinea pigs on 6 january
2015 the owner informed the aphis officials that he thought he could house up to 22 adult guinea pigs in the metal
stock water troughs. on 6 january 2015 there were 22 adult guinea pigs and their litters in tub #1 and 28 adult
guinea pigs with their litters housed in tub #2. aphis officials returned to these tubs to re-evaluate temperature the
morning of 7 january 2015. at that time, there were 40 adult guinea pigs with their litters in tub #1 and 38 in tub
#2. the troughs did not provide adequate floor space for the 28, 38 and 40 adult guinea pigs with their litters. there
were guinea pigs in each of these troughs with hair loss that were cited under veterinary care. overcrowding can
be distressful and result in the animals being more susceptible to disease and health problems. each adult guinea
pig and nursing guinea pig must be provided at least 101 square inches of floor space and each weaned guinea pig
weighing less than 350 grams must be provided at least 60 square inches of floor space for their health and
comfort.
correct by 17 january 2015."
4083,"the three oval metal stock water troughs housing a total of 97 guinea pigs with their litters had excessively wet and
dirty bedding below a layer of clean bedding. the owner informed the aphis officials that the personnel clean the
enclosures by removing the old bedding in half of the enclosure, put in new bedding, and then remove the old
bedding in the other half of the enclosure and put in new bedding. this is done while the guinea pigs were in the
enclosures. these enclosures are not being adequately cleaned or sanitized at least once every 2 weeks in the
manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. all three of these enclosures have guinea pigs with hair loss
that were cited under veterinary care. the accumulation of wet dirty bedding and lack of sanitization of the
enclosures may create an environment for the accumulation of parasites and/or growth of bacteria and fungi.
additionally, the impact to the animals due to the presence of wet bedding is further exacerbated by the extremely
cold conditions. guinea pig enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent the accumulation of
excreta or debris and at least once every 2 weeks in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
correct by 17 january 2015."
4094,"one blesbok is being housed with muntjac deer in a pasture behind the barn near the keeper building. the muntjac
deer have shelters that are too small for the blesbok to enter and there is no other shelter for this animal. the
licensee stated that the rear of the barn has stall doors to allow the blesbok access to shelter but currently the stalls
are occupied by other animals and the facility would need to move animals to allow the blesbok access to the barn.
one female white dromedary camel is being housed in the elephant ride area without adequate shelter. the animal
is housed in a pasture with the elephant ride stand. the ride stand does have a roof but has no sides and does not
provide adequate shelter for this animal. the licensee stated that the camel is in this area so she has plenty of
space to move, is away from the other camels, and is easily accessible to staff as she is bred and due to calve
soon. this poses an additional concern as the newborn calf would also need shelter from the inclement weather.
ambient day time temperatures were highest on the first day of the inspection (below 40 degrees fahrenheit as
measured by inspectors in the morning) and significantly colder on in the subsequent days (in the single digits to 20
degrees f with a significant wind chill).
both the blesbok and the dromedary camel require shelter to ensure their health and well-being. failure to provide
adequate shelter exposes animals to the weather and is especially important for the expected newborn calf.
correct this by providing these animals adequate shelter.
the licensee and his wife were informed by aphis officials on 07 january 2015 that these animals required shelter
no later than noon on friday 09 january 2015."
4095,"the three outdoor yards housing 18 sitatunga, 17 oryx, and 5 zebras, were excessively muddy on 06 january
2015. even though the facility placed large round bales of hay in the shelters for the animals allowing them to have
a dry place to stand, these yards remained muddy enough that the front loader used to move hay bales into the
sitatunga yard left ruts at least 4 inches deep. the zebra were muddy above all 4 pasterns. by 07 january 2015,
the ground was frozen due to weather. these yards require additional drainage or substrate to ensure the animals
can remain dry in all seasons. correct this by providing proper drainage to these animal yards.

4098,"the 2 bears did not have potable water in their enclosure. there was only dirty green water in a large metal pool.
the facility owner informed the aphis officials that the bears were not provided water (other than this pool) or food
from the first of december until march to encourage hibernation and discourage animals from leaving the den. one
of the bears walked out of the den and was observed in its enclosure by two of the aphis officials. bears
periodically leave their den during winter months and drink water and/or eat and do need to be provided with
potable water during winter months. drinking contaminated water may result in illness. additionally, if the facility is
not providing fresh water on a regular basis, there may not be any water during long periods of significant cold
temperatures (ie. when the pool is frozen) which could farther compromise animal health. the bears must have
access to potable water to provide for their health and comfort.
the facility owner was informed on wednesday late afternoon by the aphis officials to have this corrected by noon
on friday, 9 january 2015."
4110,"*** six outdoor yards housing 32 fallow deer, 18 sitatunga, 5 zebra, 7 kudu, 16 oryx, and 8 camel were excessively
muddy on march 10, 2015.
1. nearly the entire fallow deer enclosure is covered in mud with small puddles created from hoof prints that
have filled in with rain water. when the animals walk around on the mud they sink in about an inch. several of the
animals have mud covering their hooves and splattered up the lower portion of their legs.
2. nearly the entire sitatunga enclosure is severely muddy. the front 1/3 of the enclosure is covered by several
coalescing puddles of standing water. the remainder of the enclosure appears muddy, although there is a large
pack of straw bedding inside the shelter which appears to raise this area above the level of the pasture. all of the
animals in the enclosure were gathered inside or near one of the shelters.
3. nearly the entire zebra enclosure is muddy with very large (pond-like) puddles in the lower end and some
medium sized puddles surrounding the shelter. the mud appears several inches thick in most places. all of the
animals in the enclosure were gathered within the shelter and the majority have discoloration past their ankles
which appears to be dried mud. the flooring in the shelter appeared dry and was covered with straw.
4. nearly the entire kudu enclosure is severely muddy. the front 1/3 of the enclosure has several puddles of
standing water. the back left-hand corner of the enclosure (the side nearest the zebra) is completely under water.
the area around the water source is also severely muddy with numerous small puddles created from hoof prints
that have filled in with water.
5. nearly the entire front of the oryx enclosure is covered with excessive mud (approximately 1/3 of the
enclosure). there are large areas where animals have sunken into the mud leaving deep hoof prints which have
filled with water creating numerous puddles. this is particularly noticeable in the area surrounding the automatic
watering device. additionally, there are several vehicle tracks left in the mud which have also filled in with water
creating large puddles. several animals have mud on their legs over their ankles and mud spatter up their hind legs
as far as their hocks.
6. nearly the entire front half of the camel enclosure is covered with mud. the area around the automatic
watering device and feed troughs is severely muddy. in this area animals have repeatedly sunken into the mud
leaving deep hoof prints which have filled with water creating numerous puddles. the majority of the camels (even
those standing nearer to the shelter) have mud on their legs which varied from covering only their feet to covering
the entire lower portion of the legs below the knee.
although the weather has been warming recently resulting in melting of existing snow and the weather today is
raining, the extent of mud present is excessive. the licensee must ensure the facility has proper drainage to rapidly
eliminate excess standing water. failure to provide adequate drainage prevents animals from being able to remain
dry and can lead to the development of disease such as foot rot and dermatitis. there were 2 loads of substrate (of
two different sizes) delivered during this inspection but none had been added to these enclosures as of march 11,
2015.
*** the pasture area for 12 camels at the breeding facility is also excessively muddy near the water and food
receptacles. in this area, the animals have repeatedly sunken into the mud leaving deep hoof prints which have
filled with water creating numerous puddles. this area was muddy enough that the camels were slipping when
walking. camels standing nearest the fence line (at the end near the watering device) were observed sunken into
the mud deeply enough to cover their entire foot up to the bottom of the ankle. these animals cannot avoid this
area as they must come there to drink.
*** the pvc drain pipe for the mouse house building (which houses primates, birds, mice, rats, and a porcupine)
empties into an area near the pasture housing 3 blesbok. because of the topography of the land in that area, this
drainage mixes with current runoff from rain, melting of snow and warming of the ground. this has formed a small
stream that runs through the blesbok enclosure, past the water receptacle for the blesbok, and into a second
pasture which the blesbok can access. the blesbok were observed walking through this stream to get to 2nd
pasture. this drainage from the mouse house building is a potential hazard to the blesbok. contact with this
drainage exposes them to unnecessary health hazards.
proper drainage is required for all of these animals. the animal enclosures listed all require additional drainage or
substrate to ensure the animals can remain dry in all seasons. the licensee must also ensure that the drainage
from animal areas (such as the mouse house building) does not run through and potentially affect other animals.
correct by ensuring that suitable methods are in place to rapidly eliminate excess water and additionally by
ensuring that all such methods comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to
pollution control and environmental protection.

under the log structure. the openings allow the feet of the porcupine to pass through easily and makes it difficult for
the animal to walk or rest under the log structure, which provides shelter from the sun and inclement weather.
primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that is appropriate for the species enclosed within. the large
openings in the fencing is not appropriate for the african crested porcupine. the fencing must be replaced with a
material that does not allow the feet to pass through to prevent injury and for the comfort of the animals. correct by

injuring and animal or damaging fencing. the health of the trees should be evaluated to determine which must be
removed to protect the animals from injury and to prevent damage to enclosure fences and shelters.
***pokeweed, a poisonous plant for hoof stock is growing in several areas of the llama enclosure. there is a risk
that the animals may ingest such plants, which could potentially be a detriment to the health of the animals.

4210,"asiatic bear enclosure:
***the two (2)asiatic black bears are housed in a 20’ x 20’ x 12’ chain link enclosure with a concrete floor. within
the enclosure there is a single tire swing and a water trough for the bears to use. at the time of inspection, the
bears were noted sitting together in a pile of substrate that was place in the left front corner of the enclosure. the
current space and structures within the enclosure provide little stimulation for bears who typically enjoy climbing and
being active in water. the enclosure needs to be of an adequate size to allow the bears to make all normal
postural adjustments and adequate water features for the bear to engage in species typical exercise and
thermoregulation. additional space and elevated structures for climbing and resting and an appropriate water
feature should be added to the enclosure to allow the animals to demonstrate species typical behavior and to
improve their psychological well-being.
note: progress has been made on the construction of the new bear enclosure. upon completion the bear
enclosure will provide additional space and structures to encourage species typical behavior.
tiger enclosure:
***the three (3) tigers are housed in a 30’ x 40’ x 10’ closed top enclosure with a dirt and gravel and a single
elevated structure. no water feature is available for swim-like activity. no changes have been to the enclosure
since the last inspection that would increase the size of the enclosure or that would allow the tigers to demonstrate
more species typical behavior. tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping, and water play. tigers should be
housed in an enclosure with adequate space and structures that allows them to engage in natural behaviors. the
current enclosure must be modified or husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump,
climb, run and engage in water activities to improve their level of activity and to prevent abnormal behavior patterns.
note: work on the construction of the new enclosure has not progressed since the last inspection due to other
projects and weather conditions."

4252,"at the time of the inspection, all 8 rhinos were housed inside due to inclement weather. three intact 2-year-old males
were housed in one stall together. the apparent dominant male was behaving in an aggressive manner towards the other
two males and all three had visible scrapes and cuts around their horns, mouths and the back sides of legs from
altercations. the subordinate male had his back to a corner with his head down and had an averted gaze while remaining
alert. at one point two males were pushing each other in an aggressive manner and at another point all three males were
in a standoff for over an extended period of time with the subordinate male averting his gaze away from the other two
males. this animal came up to the inspectors for contact and quickly had to swing around to be aware of the proximity of
the other two males in the stall. having these three males in the same stall does not provide enough space while housed
indoors to be able to get away from each other physically or visually. animals housed in the same primary enclosure must
be compatible and this current housing dynamic is causing stress and discomfort to the animals as they cannot get away
from each other.

4719,"a squirrel monkey was observed moving in an abnormal behavior pattern. for several minutes the monkey would run
from top right of exhibit down a branch, perform a very specific head turn and run back up the branch to top of exhibit. the
animal had hair loss at the base of the tail and is thin with ribs and the pelvic bone visible.
the licensee had noticed these issues and the veterinarian was aware of the of the concerns regarding the animal being
thin. however, the veterinarian was not aware of the abnormal behavior patterns. the animal had been treated for internal
parasites under direction of the veterinarian but the animal did not gain weight.
repetitive abnormal behavior patterns can be an indicator of stress or illness and the condition of the monkey should be
conveyed to the vet for diagnosis and treatment options.
a lynx was observed to be thin with a concaved abdomen and prominent hip bones. the facility stated this was a normal
body condition for this individual but had done some dietary modifications and provided parasite treatment. the condition
of the lynx was not conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
although abnormalities regarding the health and well-being are being recognized, the facility staff is not communicating
them to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. failure to communicate issues pertaining to health and well-being
quickly, can delay necessary care or prevent appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

4769,"there are three adult bears (2 black bears and 1 grizzly bear) in an enclosure with 2 metal containers attached to
the primary enclosure to act as den boxes. the two metal containers are approximately 5 x 3ft, large enough to
house one adult bear. the primary enclosure’s sides are made of 2x4” wire fencing and cannot block the wind, rain,
or snow; therefore, there is not a sufficient amount of shelter space to provide all animals protection from inclement
weather. a lack of shelter directly exposes animals to any and all weather extremes and conditions. not having
adequate shelter space can cause significant suffering by impeding the animal’s ability to maintain normal body
temperature. the licensee must ensure that all animals have an adequate shelter space that is large enough for all
the animals in the enclosure to fit comfortably while being protected from the weather."
4830,"one male cougar was found to be in poor body condition at the time of inspection. both the ribs and vertebrae were
easily visible despite the length of the fur and there was little fat evident. additionally, this animal walked gingerly,
intermittently shaking each of its paws and appeared uncomfortable. the water for this animal was frozen and when
presented with water it drank for a prolonged time indicative of thirst.
the licensee stated that this animal was approximately 6 years old and that he has been thin it’s entire life. he stated
that he has discussed the condition with the attending veterinarian prior but could not recall when or how long ago. when
pressed, he stated that it likely had been more than a year and possibly several.
poor body condition and excessive thirst both can be indicators of significant disease. given the seriousness of this
condition particularly when combined with the extreme temperatures this animal needs to be examined by a veterinarian
to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided.
all exhibitors must ensure that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases.
additionally, exhibitors must ensure that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian so that timely and accurate information is conveyed regarding problems concerning animals’ health, behavior,

property owner. the licensee refused to allow aphis inspectors access to this portion of the premise during the
inspection. the licensee has been given access to the house by the property owners to check on his cubs. inspectors
requested to enter the building during the inspection so that the housing, heating, and feeding of these animals could be
evaluated. the licensee brought the cubs to the door of the house for visual assessment only. all three cubs were
vocalizing excessively and sounded hungry and/or distressed. inspectors were not able to evaluate the suitability of the
housing. the licensee also refused to answer questions about the content of the formula and shut the door after
inspectors asked where in the house the cubs were kept after less than a a minute of the inspectors observing the cubs.
when we asked where the bears were kept in the house, he refused to answer several times. he later joked that they
were kept in the “bear room” saying it was a whole room built just for them.
failing to allow inspectors access to buildings and premises where animals are housed prevents aphis officials from
determining compliance with the animal welfare act and regulations. in this case, it also prevented inspectors from
determining the cause for vocalizations which were consistent with distress of these animals. inspectors must be allowed
access to facilities and property as aphis officials determine necessary for determining compliance with the animal

the six-year-old male cougar was offered water he immediately approached and began drinking. he drank for a total of
42 seconds only stopping briefly when one of the brown bears housed next to him startled him. the length of time that
this animal drank for indicates the level of thirst and is abnormal for the time of year. this animal is suffering due to a lack
of potable water (at a drinkable temperature) being provided on a frequent enough basis. if potable water is not always

keeper that worked with the prevost squirrel attempted to voluntarily capture the animal; however, after several
unsuccessful attempts the animal was hand contained and transferred into a transport cage, totaling a time span of 45
minutes from initial attempt to final capture. approximately an hour or so later, a keeper checked on the squirrel in its

them with hand clapping, yelling and with a water hose; however, they were only able to separate them physically with
baffle boards. physical inspection of both individuals identified superficial wounds that were immediately relayed to the
attending veterinarian. the av prescribed pain medication for a period of 5 days with the option of continuing until 10
days if the animals still seemed painful. during this period, the pigs were held separately with a wooden slated wall
between them. daily observations and conversations with the facility staff indicate that the animals were spending a lot of
time together at the slated wall.
on december 20th, 2021, the facility decided to reintroduce the male pigs. the staff fed the pigs in separate locations
and, per the facility, things were going well between the animals at first. as soon as the food was gone, the pigs began
fighting again. the staff were unable to separate the males this time with two large baffle boards and after 1.5hrs, the
males separated themselves with the help of two additional curators with smaller baffle boards. staff identified that one of
the male pigs had bent his lower left tusk at a 90 degree angle. the attending veterinarian was contacted again and
returned the next day for radiographs of the jaw. radiographs confirmed that the animal had sustained a fracture to his
jaw and canine tooth, and subsequently required surgery to remove a fragment of the affected bone.
during a conversation with the attending veterinarian, it was confirmed that the facility did not contact the av for guidance
and/or approval prior to reintroducing the males. although the av did not specifically prohibit the facility from reuniting the
animals, he did suggest that fighting amongst this species is common. furthermore, the facility did not have a
documented, trained and regularly exercised plan addressing how to reintroduce conspecifics after a physical altercation.
the absence of such a plan, including intervention procedures and gradual timeline for reintroductions, resulted in animal
injury. currently, a verbal plan exists and was communicated to the usda inspector by facility staff. the facility must have

remnants of decomposed vulture carcasses could be seen scattered on the ground around the catch pens. bones and
black feathers were all that remained of the carcasses. at the time of inspection, the facility was experiencing an outbreak
of highly pathogenic avian influenza which caused the death of the vultures

with eyes still closed. when stimulated by making noises like revving the engine of the truck, clucking/whistling, and
slamming the truck door, the fallow deer barely raised her head and failed to startle or open her eyes. only when
the truck door was within feet of her and opened and slammed shut did this animal open her eyes fully and turn her
ears and head towards the source of the noise. other fallow deer that were significantly farther away (had moved
as the truck approached) startled, turned, and /or moved a short distance farther away from the noise. inspectors
observed this animal for more than 10 minutes when first encountered in the drive-through area. on exit of the
drive-through park approximately an hour later, the fallow deer was located again in a nearby area and was
observed for a similar period of time. her appearance and reactions to the same stimuli had not changed.
lethargy, dull mentation, and lack of cud-chewing in ruminant species are signs of illness and inappetence. this
animal(cid:25)s overall behavior is not normal and indicates that veterinary examination is necessary to properly diagnose
and treat this animal. correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to
the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions. note: at the conclusion of the inspection the licensee asked the farm manager to
go into the drive through to look for fallow deer that wouldn(cid:25)t move when approached. on the day of the exit
interview the farm manager informed aphis officials that facility personnel had driven through the park several
times and were unable to locate any fallow deer that were acting abnormally.
***a brown and white female boer-type goat, #7016, in the daughty barn had a significant amount dark brown
material caked on the tail, peritoneal area, and hind legs that appeared to be loose stool that had dried on the fur.
this goat was housed with 5 other goats in the same primary enclosure. the licensee stated that this animal had
had a fecal analysis performed and had been treated for coccidiosis; however, there was no record indicating this
individual had a fecal analysis or was examined by a veterinarian. additionally, a note documented in the farm's
treatment logs indicated that this animal and another individual were treated with di-methox and probios, but there
is no written authorization in the program of veterinary care on the use of these drugs in goats without additional
guidance from a licensed veterinarian. diarrhea can result from many causes including several infectious diseases
that are easily spread between animals in close contact. additionally, untreated diarrhea can cause excessive
dehydration, abdominal pain, inappetence, and weight loss. correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions including specific information regarding the
proper dose, frequency, and route of administration for all drugs that are to be used in an off-label manner.
***a female elk, #0119, was seen in the drive-through area with a large mass on the right side of her jaw. the
licensee stated that this animal is an older animal and the mass has been there for years. he indicated that he
would attempt to contact the attending veterinarian for any record of the initial evaluation of the mass; however, no
documentation of any examination taking place prior to the inspection was sent to aphis officials. there was no
written record that there has been any prior examination or documentation of the nature of this chronic condition,
treatments if required, or instructions for what to do if the condition changes. large masses may result from either
chronic or acute conditions and depending on cause may worsen causing degradation of normal tissue, infection, or
physical impairment. the location of this mass in particular can potentially cause discomfort while the animal is
eating. correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian. if no treatment is necessary
documentation including the diagnosis, nature of the condition, the expected prognosis, and any complications to
watch for that may indicate the need for additional treatments.
***the licensee stated that the attending veterinarian has made one minor change regarding the chemical restraint
methods being used that did not significantly alter how they conduct chemical restraint. the licensee was unable to
describe exactly what that change was when asked by inspectors. the current program of veterinary care still
authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or
analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species including: water buffalo, tahr goat,
aoudad, axis deer, sika deer, grevy and grants zebra, nilgai, fallow deer, eland, and elk. the veterinarian has
added an assurance that (cid:28)no invasive or painful procedures will be performed on any animal without a veterinarian
present or notified before doing so(cid:29). the veterinarian had signed the log book which includes the times and use of
tranquilizing drugs had been documented for each individual animal; however, the licensee stated he wasn(cid:25)t exactly
sure what the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s signature on that page indicated. he further stated that the attending
veterinarian was not present for all of the animals restrained using chemical restraint. according to the log
presented a total of 10 animals have been restrained using only a paralytic agent since the last inspection.
although this log contains information regarding species, animal size, dose, and the time (cid:28)down(cid:29) and (cid:28)up(cid:29), there is
no information regarding staff involved in the procedure, the reason the animal was being restrained and/or
procedures that were being done, any monitoring parameters, or notations about recovery.
succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. the use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. in addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. this facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. it is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. there are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
the licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the animal welfare act. this lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to aphis officials upon request.
this is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
note: according to the licensee, the five animals identified on the previous inspection as needing veterinary care
were not being housed on the premises at the time of this inspection. there are disposition records for the same
species of animals, though individual animal identification numbers were not included on this documentation. the
movement of these particular individual animals cannot be farther verified at this time."
5631,"the lemur enclosure consists of a solid structure with windows to the outside, which the animals have unfettered
access in and out during good weather. the structure sits on an island surrounded by a moat containing several koi
fish, and the moat is surrounded by shrubbery and a fence. there is no vertical barrier or ceiling, it is open to the
air. the records of animal inventory indicate that one young lemur (unsexed) disappeared from the enclosure.
there are no records indicating that the animal was sick or otherwise in poor health. the staff is unsure if the
animal escaped or was removed by a predator. they looked for the body and did not find it anywhere. animal
escapes or predatory deaths may occur if enclosures are not designed to prevent these events from happening.
the enclosure structure must be maintained to properly contain the animals housed therein, and also to prohibit
entry of any unwanted animals.
aphis officials returned to the facility to re-inspect the lemur exhibit and found one of the lemurs on the public side
of the moat feeding in the shrubbery between the moat and the barrier fence. the lemur ran to the area of the
moat where the caretakers walk across a submerged walking bridge and then leaped across the moat into the
exhibit. when the farm manager was informed of the animal being on the public side of the moat, he secured the
animal in the indoor area of the facility.

5648,"the public is permitted to walk directly up to the primary enclosures containing several species of animals including
goats, sheep, zebu cattle, llama, and camels. these animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk
through area (for the sheep, goats, zebu, camels and llama) and the wagon loading area where one camel is
housed in a horse stall. there are no barriers present at the walk through area to discourage public contact and the
guests can feed food sold at the entry gate. during this inspection, no public visitors were noted in this area of the
park due to poor weather. the facility representative stated that an employee has been hired to work fridays
through mondays as an attendant in the area. however, there was no attendant present during this inspection on a
tuesday. guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals since primary enclosure fences are made
of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. unattended public
contact does not ensure safe public interaction with the animals. the licensee must ensure that during periods of
public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. correct by placing barriers to prevent public
contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these

employees continue to drive the horse-drawn wagons and monitor the visitors on their wagon. however, no
attendants were present in the drive through area when the unaccompanied personal vehicle visits were taking
place. during this inspection, the inspectors noticed guests feeding animals through car windows and no employees
were noted in the vicinity. a hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry gate advises them to remain in their
vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants
present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the animals and
the public. correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact."

tube was not. in addition, the (cid:28)""bag""(cid:29) on the isoflorane machine fell off at some point in the process, preventing staff
from assisting with respiration for the animal. the absence of emergency drugs and appropriate equipment hinders
the ability to respond in case of a medical emergency. the facility must use appropriate methods to diagnose, treat

****two separate enclosures housing the four lar (white handed) gibbons contained loose-watery stool. one singly
housed female lar gibbon was observed expelling watery stool during the inspection. when asked, a primate
keeper and interim superintendent stated that it is normal for white handed gibbons to have loose stool. they also
stated that these animals have always had loose stool since arriving at the facility. as part of the facility'(cid:25)s
preventative program of veterinary care, the animals undergo parasite screening via fecal exams twice per year.
however, these exams have not been done recently, to screen for potential causes of the watery stool. additionally,
no other diagnostic tests have been done in order to determine the cause of the on-going current problems.
watery stool is abnormal and may be an indication of an underlying health issue including bacterial or parasitic
infection, increased stress or inappropriate diet.

record regarding this abnormal behavior. when asked about this abnormal behavior, the attending veterinarian
stated to the vmos that she was aware that the animal paced but had not been consulted regarding the behavior by
the zoo staff. this abnormal behavior suggests that the animal may be experiencing psychological stress. the av
must evaluate the animal and be involved in the development of a plan, implementation and follow-up of that plan,
to minimize the stress and abnormal behavior of this animal.

caretakers earlier in the morning and there was no water available in the water receptacle at the time of inspection
for the goat or sheep pens.
the situation was immediately corrected by refilling the receptacles and turning the water off to prevent continued
spill over, and there is a plan to fix the mechanism today. one goat came over and drank water as the receptacle
was filling, but only drank for 10-20 seconds. when the automatic water supply is shut off, either additional water
receptacles should be available or the water should be manually turned on as often as needed to maintain fresh
water for the animals until the automatic system is working again.

non-weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. it can result from numerous causes including both
infectious and non-infectious. failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment
can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***a juvenile female goat had abnormal skin covering the tips of her ears. the skin was crusty and dry, with large
areas of hair loss. her overall hair coat appeared dull and she was seen to be scratching her shoulder along the
chain link fencing. the animal manager stated that he had not noticed this skin condition prior to the usda
inspection. skin disease can be caused by a variety of problems, including infection, allergies, injuries, irritation, or
other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing to the animal.

the animal manager stated she was eating normally, but could not describe what he considered to be normal or
any changes in diet or feeding. the animal manager stated to aphis staff that the eye has gotten much worse
since november and continues to deteriorate. he described the animal as continuing to become more aggressive
and that she has become dangerous to handle. he stated that the last time that any veterinarian has examined the
animal was on november 18, 2016 when she came to the facility and administered injectable antibiotics and used a
needle to inject “something” directly into the eye. he noticed that they eye was a little better after the veterinary
treatment on november 18, 2016 and it initially reduced in size and appeared to heal. on that same date, the
veterinarian discussed a plan of treatment to include daily administration of bnp eye ointment and possibly stitching
the eye shut to allow it to heal if treatment didn’t result in improvement.
according to the animal manager, he continued to apply eye ointment as directed for approximately 10 days.
they noted on their logs on november 28, 2016 that the eye was back down to a normal size, mainly dark, with
milky opacity in the center. the eyeball was also no longer red or swollen. they continued to apply eye ointment
on a daily basis as directed by the veterinarian.
on december 6, 2016 staff made a notation on the animal treatment log that the eye had deteriorated again, and
was “very bad.” the licensee wrote in her log that she spoke to the attending veterinarian on that date and was
advised that the animal needed follow up. the facility continued eye ointment and noted that the condition of the
eye was worsening throughout december and january. despite the recommendation by the attending veterinarian
to have the animal reexamined, there is no record that it ever was.
on january 27, 2017 the facility noted on the treatment logs that they had ceased giving eye ointment. when
questioned further, the animal manager stated that they felt “the eye looked better without it”. he stated due to the
aggressive behavior of the animal it was becoming difficult to administer the ointment or to even capture the animal.
the licensee made the decision to discontinue use of the eye ointment on their own accord and admitted that this
was not approved by the av. the animal manager stated that after watching the av inject the eye during her visit
on november 18, 2016 he decided that he would also try to “pop” the eye on his own, in an attempt to improve the
overall condition of the eye. he stated that on several occasions over the last few months he has confined the
animal, popped the eye both manually with his fingers and also with a needle, and then applied gentamicin
ointment to the eye. during his self-prescribed procedure of the eye, he stated that there was a red fluid that came
out with resembled “watered down blood” and that he did not notice any pus.

eye issues can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation, or other medical
conditions. this animal is already exhibiting signs of pain and distress. the delay in providing necessary follow up
veterinary care appears to have resulted in unnecessary pain and suffering. in addition the ‘care’ provided without
veterinary approval may have resulted in unnecessary distress and contributed to worsening of the condition.

more permanent solution for providing this pig with an enclosure that allows him to stay dry, warm, and out of the
mud needs to be implemented. one alternative to considered is to cover the slatted awning with a solid material so
that the rain does not runoff into the pig enclosure but to the outside of the courtyard allowing the pig enclosure to

background or training resulted in significant injuries to one employee, injuries to the park superintendent, and the undue
stress and ultimate traumatic death of the three-year-old whitetail buck, “johnny.”
the licensee must ensure that there are enough adequately trained employees to maintain the professionally acceptable
level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart for the species on site and supervised by someone who has a
background in animal care. this is essential to protect the health and well-being of the animals, as well as the safety of
the employees and the members of the public.

**direct--a male tiger named rajah had been noted to have a quarter-sized mass on the left side of the tail during
the inspection conducted on 28 may 2014 which was to be examined by a veterinarian by 4 june 2014. the av did
a visual evaluation on 3 june 2014 and determined that anesthesia would be required to fully examine this lesion
and that it would need to be done when the temperatures were not too warm to avoid overheating of the animal
during the procedure. no examination by the av had been performed at the time of this inspection (7 months since
first noted) and the mass is now significantly larger with a reddened center. masses and growing lesions may be
due to infection, cancer, or other serious veterinary conditions. this animal needs to be examined by the av as
soon as possible with appropriate diagnostic testing to determine if the mass needs to be surgically removed or if
other treatment is needed to prevent the condition from worsening. documentation of the examination, diagnostic
testing performed, treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be made and be
available for review by aphis inspectors.
**direct--a male white tiger named o-jaus housed with 2 female white tigers, samundra and subadra, was noted
during this inspection to be in thin body condition and had a very unusual posture and gait. his backbone area
appeared hunched with the vertebral processes appearing more prominent. his hind feet appear pigeon-toed as he
walks, that he is carefully placing the hind feet, and his hips sway noticeably. the care takers present during this
part of the inspection were not aware if this was a recent development and no documentation of weight loss or
abnormal gait had been made at the time of this inspection by the animal care staff or by the av. weight loss and
abnormal gait are indicators of an underlying veterinary condition (nutritional, arthritis, injury, etc) and this animal
needs to be examined by the av with documentation of possible diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and
plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the av.
**direct--a juvenile male red kangaroo, rascal, was noted to have numerous circular lesions on his tail by one of
the care staff accompanying the inspection. upon close examination, there were at least a dozen areas varying
from pea to quarter- size where the skin was reddened and the hair was missing in a circular pattern. the av had
not been notified of this condition which may be ringworm, a fungal infection contagious to animals and people
(zoonosis), or some other skin or hair condition. documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including
any diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs
to be made and available for review by aphis inspectors.
**direct--the male leopard, bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on
his tail. one of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail
sometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. the current areas had not been documented by care staff
nor reported to the av for evaluation. this animal needs to be examined by the av with documentation of possible
diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the av.
- two adult male leopards, bagheera and jabaree, were noted to have unusual pigmentation of their left eyes.
bagheera had a block of brown-copper color on the pigmented portion of the eye and jabaree(cid:25)'s entire left eye
appeared to be reddish-brown in color. the licensee stated that the leopards(cid:25) have had this condition since they
were cubs but the aphis inspectors have never been able to observe these animals during inspection as they
always hide in their enclosures or den boxes when the licensee is accompanying the inspection. the licensee was
not present during this portion of the inspection and the leopards both came up to the enclosure fencing and
allowed a thorough examination. this is not a normal presentation for the eyes of leopards and there is no
documentation or information indicating what is causing the condition, how long it has been present, or whether
there is any need for monitoring and treatment of the eye condition by the av. changes in the coloration of the eye
may be a genetic condition or could indicate an underlying problem such as infection and needs to be evaluated by
the av.
- a male serval named limpopo was pacing the front of his enclosure during this inspection and was noted to have
several rough areas in his hair coat on his back. this may be matted hair which can be due to lack of grooming or
underlying injury or infection and should be evaluated by the av.
- three ring tailed lemurs, bongo, talisa, and taz, were noted to have significant thinning and hair loss on their tails
that had not been documented by the care staff nor evaluated by the av. thinning hair and loss of hair may be a
sign of overgrooming by conspecifics or by the individual animal due to stress or dominance issues, underlying
veterinary condition (endocrine, infection, allergies), or due to trauma to the hair follicles and needs to be evaluated
by the av. documentation of examination of these animals(cid:25)' tails, including any diagnostic testing, monitoring and
treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition needs to be made and available for review by
aphis inspectors.
--a ring tailed lemur named abu was noted to be obese and had prominent raised areas on both hip areas. the
care staff accompanying this portion of the inspection had not noted this condition and no documentation of this was
available for aphis at the time of the inspection. the licensee stated during the exit briefing that these were saddle
bags(cid:29) but the av had not examined this animal to determine what was causing the raised areas or lumps on abu'(cid:25)s
hips which may be excess fat or may be a due to a veterinary condition .
- a hedgehog named cow was noted to be awake and actively running around his enclosure in the welcome center
during daylight hours (nocturnal animal typically). both of his eyes appeared to have white centers which may
indicate cataracts or another veterinary condition that may affect his vision. this condition had not been noted by
any of the care staff nor had the av been notified at the time of this inspection.
- the carnivores (tigers, lions, bears, caracal, serval, savannah cat, leopards, bobcat, cougar) are not being fed a
commercially prepared diet that is nutritionally complete. no diet plan is documented nor approved by the av for
these animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological
needs. numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body
condition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than
adults to meet their growth needs. one of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was
questioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of
the vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.
for example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the
care staff. the recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a
meat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to
meet these animals daily requirement of calcium. additionally, the licensee hand-raises tiger cubs and does not
have a documented diet plan to ensure these cubs receive the appropriate nutrition to ensure their healthy growth to
adulthood.
animals that are not being fed a commercially prepared, nutritionally complete diet appropriate for the species and
to ensure their health and well-being need to have a diet plan documented and approved by the av that is
maintained, followed, updated as necessary for new animals or changes in their age or physiologic needs, and able
to be reviewed by aphis inspectors.
the facility must have an established program of veterinary care which ensures problems are identified and
communicated to the av and that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat veterinary conditions
are used.
the following animals need to examined by the av by 14 jan 2015:
tiger rajah, tiger ojaus, kangaroo rascal, leopard bagheera
all other animals and the nutrition plan for any animals not receiving a commercially prepared diet for their species
and physiologic needs must be evaluated by the av by 2 feb 2015."

significant fire hazard.the construction of the cover for the heater does not allow easy access for cleaning. the
surfaces of housing facilities--including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. furniture-type fixtures or objects must be sturdily constructed and must be strong

9670,"- the water receptacles for several animals in the park including; limpopo(serval), dexter (camel), orion(cougar)
and shakita (tiger) had an accumulation of reddish, greenish brown algae debris on the sides and bottom of the
automatic watering receptacles. this is an indication that the water receptacles are not being adequately cleaned,
which could result in contamination of the drinking water. lack of access to potable water is extremely dangerous
for animals. water needs to be provided frequently enough to meet the physiologic needs of the animals and to
prevent dehydration which can lead to serious health issues, such as renal failure. if potable water is not accessible
to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. all water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary.

inflamed or injured. the appearance of the eye suggests that an infection or inflammation is present. the attending
veterinarian had not been consulted prior to the time of inspection. the licensee stated that they first noticed the
eye condition a week ago. currently the licensee is treating the affected eye with clear eye drops. the licensee
stated they had been treating the eye with an ointment that was prescribed by the attending veterinarian for another
dog at the licensee’s facility. the licensee stated the last of the ointment was used the prior day and that they had
disposed of the empty tube. the licensee was unable to find the tube so the name of the ointment used on this dog

10778,"on april 16, 2014 3 wolves escaped from their enclosure. the animals also gained access to the exterior of the
property. 2 of the animals were recaptured within the following 24 hours.
the third animal was never recaptured and was found dead outside of the installation around may 11 2014,
presumably hit by a car.
handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
during the time in which this animal was loose, it was shot and hit by a immobilizing dart ""14 times"" , yet it never
went down and ran into the dense forest that is around this area, (shooting and hitting the animal with a dart at
least 14 times is not considered adequate handling ). also wolfrun used 2 types of traps to try to catch the animal
with no positive results.
although the roughness of the area and the dense forest did not facilitate the recovery efforts and the multiple
attempts of the facility to recover the escaped animal, the measures taken were not sufficient and/or appropriate.
this facility does not have staff trained to handle dangerous animals specifically regarding capture, handling,
immobilization, anesthesia, and tranquilization. a facility representative stated: ""one person on the dart team is
retired navy and the other has been hunting since he was age six; both men have excellent skills with guns"" ( the
second person was not an employee of the facility). ""excellent skills with guns"" is only part of an adequate
qualification. the failure to re-capture this animal and its subsequent death puts in serious doubt the
appropriateness of the measures taken to recapture the animal.
without proper training the staff doesn't know how to handle the anesthetics and/or tranquilizers to use in the
recapture of escaped animals. (type of medicine, dosage, size of the darts, etc.) in addition, the facility personnel
have not demonstrated that they know how to use the darts, prevent injuries, and put them in the most suitable area
depending on the species of the animal.
the failure to handle the animal properly and in a timely manner (recovered) evolved into the death of the animal
and this is not in compliance with the requirements of the awa 2.131 (b) (1) handling: ""handling of all animals shall
be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.""
the escape and re-capture plan lacks information and guidance about which medicines can be used, when it can
be used, and how to use them (dosage, etc.). it also lacks guidance on when and how to quickly remove animals if
they are a threat to public safety.
the licensee must develop and maintain a complete and current plan to follow in the event of escape of any of the
animals; in addition it is necessary that all the employees receive basic training in this plan, and that this facility
regularly performs escape drills exercises with all the employees and volunteers. also all necessary measures must
be taken to prevent the reoccurrence of this kind of outcome, including additional training in the safety measures
necessary for the prevention of escapes for the entire staff of this facility.
professional training in adequate humane capture and handling of the animals is recommended for this facility.
some possible options include: the workshops from organizations like safe capture group, the invitation of
specialists in the management of captive wild animals and/or training from recommended personnel from other
facilities with good escape and re-capture plans can be some of the possibilities to use for this training.
all the preventive measures, trainings and plans must be documented and must be available to the aphis officials
at the time of inspection.

assign and approve the treatment plan. the sutures subsequently dehisced two days later.
failure to promptly communicate findings with the attending veterinarian delays proper treatment and may cause undue
pain and distress in animals with such conditions. the facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian in order to timely convey accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being. this communication is essential for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.

place. the supplements fed daily to the animals, are not being stored appropriately since they are maintained year-round
in an open shaded structure subject to outdoor weather conditions. the structure cannot provide a dry place on rainy days
as evidenced by the wet floor and puddles of water leftover from a rainstorm that passed during the previous night. the
storage structure does not have temperature control measures and therefore cannot provide for a cool place on the many
hot days in florida when the temperature rises to or above 86 degrees fahrenheit. additionally, the fish oil dispenser was
dirty, largely covered in brown-yellow sticky material, mainly on the pump head and the handle. inappropriately stored

for closer inspection. the rabbit was cold to the touch and its hindquarters were covered with diarrhea. it was
determined by the facility employee that the animal met the criteria for euthanasia. it was euthanized. all animals
must be observed daily to assess their health status. the time this rabbit was observed was between 11:30 am
and 12:00 pm. facility employees arrive at about 7:00 am. it is critical that animals in need of veterinary care be
identified in a timely manner in order to not subject these animals to unnecessary pain and distress. the condition

gallon should be used depending on the purpose. at a minimum, these nest boxes must be cleaned with a
detergent followed by a disinfectant. no detergent is being used and the bleach is not being used at an effective
concentration. the primary enclosure cages are being sanitized every 30 days according to a facility employee.
the cages, cage racks and cage pans are power washed using cold water. this is not an effective cleaning and
disinfection process. at a minimum, these items need to be cleaned with a detergent followed by a disinfectant. in
addition to this, nearly all the cage racks and cage pans are covered with a heavy urine scale. the cage rack
casters are covered with very heavy rust and multiple urine guards are rusting below where the cage lixits are
located. the condition of these items makes it impossible to properly clean and sanitize them. improper cleaning
and sanitization can cause disease problems as many viruses, bacteria and internal parasites are not removed or
destroyed by using only cold water or water containing improperly diluted bleach. these items must be cleaned and
repaired or replaced. a safe and effective cleaning and sanitization procedure must be developed and followed.

11532,"on june 23rd 2021, an adult male cynomolgus macaque (id #mb-996) died unexpectedly during a routine blood
harvesting procedure while anesthetized. upon initiating the procedure, the employee noticed the primate’s blood was
darker than normal, alerting the licensee who was also present in the room. chest compressions were initiated, but they
were unable to resuscitate the primate.
immediately following, the employee expressed concern that mb-996’s demise was a result of oxygen deprivation due to
improper placement on the transport cart prior to the procedure. when questioned about the positioning of the four
sedated primates for this procedure, no malpositioning was identified by anyone present in the room, including the
employee who voiced this concern.
the facility conducted an internal investigation, interviewing all parties involved. though the employee stated they began
cpr after noticing mb-996’s dark-tinged blood, another technician present stated the employee was unaware the primate
stopped breathing. it wasn’t until the technician brought it to the employee’s attention 5-7 minutes after the procedure
began that chest compressions were initiated; blood was already drawn and collected in tubes by this time. the internal
investigation concluded mb-996 was alive when placed on the employee’s processing table, and remained in the same
position for several minutes before it was declared deceased. there was no overt evidence derived from direct
observations by anyone in the processing room that observed mb-996 was in respiratory distress prior to its death.
the inspector followed-up with the attending veterinarian during the inspection. they suspected the cause of mb-966’s
death was not related to the transport cart conformation, but the lack of observation and monitoring in the processing
room.

in the food barn in a plastic bucket on the floor. there was a space heater next to the chicken to assist with the
thawing process. the current method of thawing food in the winter does not protect the meat from thawing in an
uneven manner. thawing in this type of uncontrolled manner increases the chances of food spoilage and
contamination.

significant risk to the health of the animal and it is imperative that a diet that is nutritious and an appropriate quantity
is fed daily as directed by the attending veterinarian.
*** the diet prep area does not have running water in the winter. as a result, food prep items (knives, cutting

stated to avoid direct contact, pads and blankets were used between the patient and the electric heating pad. a water
circulating heating pad was initially used but began to leak and was replaced with the electric heating pad. once the skin
ulcerations were observed, the veterinary staff was notified, and the pig was treated and given supportive care. the

conducted by the dlam veterinary staff. according to the facility, precautions were taken to ensure the safety and well-
being of the animals while awaiting to undergo this procedure. although precautions were taken, approximately two hours
after these animals were moved to the temporary cage, it was discovered that a single cage containing the two guinea
pigs had not received sufficient airflow, resulting in premature death of the animals due to asphyxiation. failure to use a
cage with appropriate airflow, for an extended period of time, may have caused these animals to experience behavioral
stress and unnecessary discomfort before death. the veterinary staff immediately reported the incident and has taken
corrective action to ensure temporary holding cages have lids with larger openings to increase airflow. handling of all

area contains dried, crusty green/yellow discharge and there is associated hair loss. the dog was treated from january
13-20, 2023 with cephalexin but when the attending veterinarian was on premises on march 1, 2023 there was no
recheck performed. a facility representative stated they recently treated the condition with ivomec but did not document it.
the licensee is required to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in the
regulated animals. the licensee is required to have the above mentioned animals evaluated by a veterinarian for an
accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. the licensee must ensure each animal receives adequate
veterinary care at all times.
the following dogs have matted hair coats:
* female pomsky (tattoo #5, microchip #893156) has a severely matted hair coat along the top of her back and behind
both shoulders. the hair has become matted into thick clumps which are tight against the skin.
* female pomsky (tattoo #9, microchip #982224) has a severely matted hair coat along both sides of the body from the
shoulders to the rump. the hair is matted into thick, firm clumps which are tight against the skin.
* female wheaton (tattoo #147, microchip 3568183) has a heavily matted hair coat. the inspectors were unable to
physically examine the dog due to its behavior, but were able to observe the matted hair is located across the top of the
dog's head and throughout its entire hair coat.
* male wheaton (tattoo #5) has a large, matted section of hair located at the top of the back near the left hip. trapped
within the matted hair is a dark colored crusty material. the facility representative stated that the dog had recently had a
medical condition beneath the matted hair that had been exuding a discharge.
* female cocker spaniel (tattoo #11, microchip #1389898) has a matted hair coat. the dog had been treated for a
wound and the hair surrounding the area is matted into tight clumps and the hair beneath the tail has dried fecal material
attached to it.
matted hair and material trapped within the hair could cause pain and discomfort to the animal, as well as lead to further
health issues.
each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. the licensee
must have the matted hair and material removed from the hair coats of these affected dogs. the licensee must ensure
that the hair coat of each dog remains clean and free of matted hair at all times in order to support the health and well-
being of the animals."

items on the october, 2013 annual veterinary visit report which the veterinarian recommended, but which were not
implemented include: having a veterinary assistant review fecal parasite identification techniques, consulting the
state parasitology department in a parasite control program, rechecking certain animals' blood work, euthanasia of a
bull due to poor quality of life (this bull was transferred to another facility), provide cold storage of food. the

veterinary care issue with the chimpanzees being diagnosed with whipworms last year by the veterinary technician
caretaker. during this inspection, at least 4 ibex were observed limping on their front legs. the owner states the
ibex get a hoof interdigital irritation whenever there is persistent rainy weather and then they treat the ibex with a
spray which heals the foot and stops the limping. during this inspection it had rained continuously for two days, but
no limping animals have been treated. the veterinarian has not been consulted about this recurring lameness
condition. the veterinarian must be consulted so that appropriate and adequate veterinary care is provided. for
recurring issues, veterinary approved treatment plans can be developed to provide immediate treatment to reduce
pain and treat illness/disease."

2 alpacas, and 3 juvenile animals including a watusi, bison, and scottish highlander. after a two day rain, the
shelter is entirely wet and muddy. although these animals also have an open sided shelter, the nights are still cold
and the animals need the protection of a sided shelter where they can stay dry and protected from the cold winds
and rain. in the testing barn currently being used by 8 goats, apparently the roof leaks severely as there is a
puddle of water in the aisleway measuring over twenty feet long and up to three feet wide. the roofs or other
structures of these shelters need to be repaired or replaced to provide protection for the animals from rain. to be
corrected by 4-5-14."
12593,"the 8 alpacas which were in the park all summer were not sheared this past summer season. temperatures this
past summer were consistently in the upper 90s to 100s. a white alpaca in the inner park is covered with thick ropy
hair over its trunk. when this alpaca was palpated through the thick hair, its ribs, spine and pelvic bones could
easily be felt. the only feed observed for these animals was a small amount of wet hay. this animal hair needs to
be thinned to remove some of the knotting and check the skin underneath. in the future, all fleece producing
animals need to be sheared on a regular basis before summer heat. the alpacas need to be checked by the
attending veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment of weight loss and shearing recommendations.
the written program of veterinary care states the wolf hybrids will be given monthly heartworm preventative. the
keeper records reviewed for the past 6 month do not indicate any administration of heartworm prevention
medications to regulated canids. the attending veterinarian needs to be consulted about how to proceed with
blood parasite prevention for these canids."

13139,"during the inspection, a newborn rabbit was noted stuck in the wire mesh floor of its enclosure, with its head and
forelegs through an opening in the floor and facing down towards the ground. the newborn was at first thought to
be dead, but closer inspection revealed that it was in fact breathing and struggling in spastic movements. the
moribund condition of this animal and the fact that it was stuck in the floor of the enclosure was alerted to the facility
representative, who began to try to extricate the baby rabbit. at first the head and forelegs were grasped and
squeezed, trying to force the baby rabbit back up through the mesh floor. after ~1 minute at this attempt, the facility
representative retrieved some long-handled graspers to try to reach the newborn from the inside of the enclosure,
as his arms were not long enough to extend to the back of the four-foot long enclosure. the graspers were placed
around the middle of the newborn, behind the shoulders, and then used to try to elevate the newborn(cid:25)s legs to the
point of popping through the floor and back inside the enclosure. this effort was continued for approximately
another minute before the newborn was successfully extricated from the opening in the floor and returned to the
nest box. at that time, the inspectors asked the facility representative if he would prefer to have the inspection
stopped so that he could further remedy the situation by relocating the animals to a different enclosure; the
representative declined doing so and stated that he could take care of it after the inspection was completed.
handling this newborn rabbit in such a way with the graspers in an attempt to extricate it from its position could
cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. additionally, it was unclear how or why the newborn
rabbit got into that position in the first place, but potential causes could include: falling out of the nest box, trying to
escape the nest box if it was excessively warm or dirty for the newborn(cid:25)s comfort, or being chased or dragged out
by either of the adult rabbits in the enclosure. some or all of these factors may have contributed to the newborn
becoming entrapped in the wire mesh flooring, and the handling practices leading up to this incident were not done

physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. correct by ensuring that handling of all animals is done in an

this area. the exhaust fan was moving slowly and was covered with an excessive amount hair, cobwebs and debris
at the time of inspection. 85% of the walls of the building are covered with animal enclosures stacked on top of each
other, the fronts and sides of which were also covered with an excessive amount of calcium buildup, excreta, hair,
cobwebs, debris, and other organic material. the ammonia levels in this area were high enough to
irritate the inspectors' nose, throat and eyes. due to the inadequate cleaning of the building and enclosures, paired
with the use of the exhaust fan alone as the single method of ventilation, the
ammonia levels were elevated to a rate that was noxious to the inspectors after being inside, with the door open, for
just a few minutes. the air quality inside this structure was not sufficient to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals housed therein. this facility must ensure that they have adequate ventilation for all rabbit areas to alleviate
odor, high ammonia levels and to provide fresh air, and to use auxiliary methods of ventilation when the ambient
temperature is above 85f.

13175,"several enclosures containing nonhuman primates showed areas of excessive rust. in the kansas area there are multiple
enclosures exhibiting excessive rust along the cage fencing and gate poles. in the ""peanut gallery"" enclosure containing
two capuchin monkeys, the ground level pole of the enclosure entry gate had severely rusted to the point where the metal
was degraded and falling away. several of the metal “runways”, especially at the feeding stations, show excessive rust
along the cage wire, to the point of pitting and break down of the metal.
several wire outdoor enclosures housing squirrel monkeys were secured with rusted bolts and washers. in one squirrel
monkey enclosure, d7, the bolts and washers along the resting platform supporting the heat cave had significantly rusted.
excessive rust can compromise structural strength, present roughened and jagged surfaces where it is possible for the
animal to injure themselves, and prevent proper cleaning and sanitization of a surface. any surface that comes in contact
with the nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface.
when speaking with facility representative they stated the facility has a plan to address any rusted caging and enclosure
materials. there was visible evidence of ongoing repair and replacement of rusted surfaces however some cages had
been missed or not yet addressed.

13492,"drainage and waste disposal.
the ""six pen"" sheltered enclosures had wet concrete on their outside portions after being hosed down earlier in the
day. due to minimal slope, abundant shade, and likely other factors, the concrete floors apparently remain wet a
good portion of the day. the dogs end up with wet hair on their paws/legs and eventually track fecal material
throughout their enclosures-both inside and out. this results in many of them not being able to sit or lay down in a
clean, dry area. this was especially noticeable on several small white dogs that had brown material soiling the hair
on their legs, chests, backs, and/or hind ends. on one dog, the soiled hair was forming mats on the dog's hind end.
proper drainage of water and waste is necessary to keep the dogs dry during cold months and prevent their coats
from becoming contaminated with waste material.
the licensee must ensure that there is regular and frequent collection and removal of animal waste and water in a
manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. additionally, the licensee must ensure that the drainage

inadequate to prevent their accumulation. cleaning is still not being done at a rate to decrease accumulation of
excreta, urine soaked areas or food waste. the meat that was put into the enclosure had an accumulation of fly
eggs due to the heat and moisture over the past 2 days, and has not been eaten or the left over waste removed.
accumulated organic debris provides an optimal area for the growth of bacterial and fungal pathogens creating a
disease hazard for the dogs. additionally, this accumulated debris can attract pests including flies and vermin as

material was dried and the accumulated material was both on top and in between the slatted floor openings. the
feces were so prevalent throughout the flooring that it was difficult for the dogs in those three enclosures to walk
around the outdoor portion of their enclosures without stepping in fecal material. the licensee stated that it had

grant(cid:25)s zebra ((cid:24)dot(cid:25)). according to the licensee, employees reported that on 30 may 2014, a zebra escaped from
her enclosure when a tram entered the hoofstock exhibit. the licensee stated that facility protocol mandates that in
the case of an animal escape, that he is to be called immediately, and that he will coordinate the recapture effort.
however, he was not called at the time of this incident. the licensee reported that the employees broke protocol by
attempting to recapture the zebra using all-terrain vehicles, and that during the recapture attempt that the zebra ran
into the enclosure fence and subsequently expired. this animal was not handled in a manner which prevented
physical harm or unnecessary discomfort, which ultimately contributed to the animal(cid:25)s death. the licensee must
ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort at all times.

collapse if the cow attempted to stand on it, resulting in substantial injuries. additionally, the top of the metal wire -filled
gate in front of the enclosure was bent downward and damaged.
**the outdoor enclosure for the wallaby contained a wooden shelter with a large hole and deteriorating wood located at
the lower back corner of the shelter. the damaged wood had multiple jagged edges, which could potentially injure the
animal.

observation by the inspectors. the puppy's eyelids were partially closed and the hair surrounding both eyes was
wet and the hair on her rump was also wet. physical examination of the puppy's gums revealed that they were
extremely pale to white in color. the puppy was weak and limp while being held and her body was cold to the
touch. when the puppy was returned to her enclosure, she was laid out flat on her side and made no attempt to
move or raise her head.

grey mucoid-like discharge present in the corner of it. the fur surrounding the majority of the eye appeared wet with
eye discharge. this discharge extended down the nose and face from the corner of the eye. the fur in this area
appeared to be discolored red to dark brown. there also appeared to be a divot-like lesion on the surface of the
eye closest to the corner of the eye. the eye was pinkish red around this lesion. the rest of the eye appeared blue
to green to grey and individual eye structures were not easily visible within the eye. several red vessel-like
structures were observed on the inside of the eye and in the surrounding white tissues. according to written
documentation at the facility, the licensee had “treated for sore eyes” on september 28, 2016. on october 1, 2016
there was a notation that the dog was better and “no treatment needed’. according to the licensee, the dog had not
been treated for an eye condition since october 1st and he had not had the dog seen by a veterinarian for its eye
condition. the cloudy eye and discharge could be the result of an injury, infection or other veterinary condition
which may cause discomfort.

white tissue under its eyelids. according to the licensee, he had treated for a cold in the dog’s eyes when it was a
young puppy and was still with its littermates which he thought had similar conditions but this dog’s eye did not
respond as well as the others. the dog also had some hair loss on the outside ear flaps. both ears had raised, red,
crusty, scab-like lesions in the areas of hair loss. the right ear was more affected than the left; the right ear also
had a small red and scab-like lesion on the inside of it near its edge. a similar scab-like lesion was observed on the
top of the dog’s head. this dog had not been examined by a veterinarian for either condition nor was there any
documentation at the facility of any treatment given to the dog for either condition. this dog’s conditions could be
due to injury, infection or other veterinary medical conditions.

24348,"a 6-year-old adult neutered male california sea lion (“jester”) had a history of recurrent medical problems affecting his
eyes. on november 14th, 2019, jester was examined by the attending veterinarian and the presence of a large corneal
ulcer was noted on the surface of his left eye, and trainers noted that the animal was “not eating as regularly as before”.
on february 11th, 2020 his left eye was noted to be worsening (“corneal ulcer subjectively seems deeper”), and he
continued to receive treatment by the attending veterinarian. he underwent surgery on his left eye on march 5th, 2020 at
which time it was noted that lesion was a “desmetocoele” (very deep eye ulcer). at the time of surgery, his right eye also
had a bluish grey lesion on its surface which was not ulcerated. jester died under anesthesia.
water quality records from the pool where jester was housed consistently had total chlorine levels of 2.2 parts per million
(ppm) and free chlorine levels ranging from 0.1 ppm to 0.95 ppm in the month before his death. free chlorine exceeded
0.5 ppm every day, often multiple times each day, from february 8th, 2020 to february 25th, 2020. the highest free
chlorine measured during this timeframe was 0.95 ppm free chlorine on february 18th, 2020.
facility management stated that the general aim for water on this system is to maintain free chlorine in the 0.3 to 0.5 ppm
range in order to kill coliforms (bacteria). facility records indicate that this target was lowered to the “0.2 range” on
february 26th because jester was being prepared for surgery and they wanted to “fix anything and everything” leading up
to the surgery. facility management stated, “there is no question that chlorine is irritating to the eyes.” from february
26th to march 5th the free chlorine was often in the 0.2-0.3 ppm range, while total chlorine remained around 2.2 ppm.
the consulting ophthalmologist confirmed that many of the other animals at the facility have eye problems. the attending
veterinarian confirmed that 4 out of 5 sea lions on this water system have ocular issues, all of whom are under 10-years-
old. jester had been living at the facility since 2015, and he did not have any eye lesions when he arrived at the facility.
a usda marine mammal specialist visited the facility on august 27th, 2019 and the specialist told facility management
that the chlorine was too high and needed to be reduced to better support animal health. at that time, facility management
indicated that their chlorine levels were maintained at less than 1 ppm total chlorine.
since june 2020, records from this water quality system show that total chlorine was often more than 1.5 ppm, and was
regularly above 1.8 ppm. records show that free chlorine often regularly exceeded 0.5 ppm.
chlorine may contribute to the development and worsening of eye disease in captive sea lions. chlorine and its
byproducts are extremely irritating to eyes and mucus membranes, yet captive sea lions depend on pools of water in their
enclosure to maintain normal body temperature and to exercise normal behaviors. ulcers, infections, and inflammation on
the surface of the eye are extremely painful and may cause vision loss, and may affect an animal’s willingness or ability to
eat, swim, ambulate, or rest comfortably. animals with ulcerated eyes are especially vulnerable to the pain and irritation
caused by exposure to chlorinated water. sea lions are a high anesthetic risk, so eye problems that progress to a level
where anesthesia or surgery is needed are especially hazardous to the animals’ health and longevity.
correct by maintaining appropriate levels of chlorine in marine mammal enclosures or an alternative system to maintain
ideal water quality so there is no detrimental effect to the health of the animals contained therein. temporary correction

were present to assist. jag was voluntarily trained for the treatment and had received them in this pool previously without
incident. the ed stated there has not been a malfunction of the restraint system of the medical pool during the 10 years
of its use. due to the frequency of the treatments, manual restraint was now required for jag. while being handled for his
therapy, jag pushed through the trainers and swam beneath the false bottom of the pool enclosure. despite immediate
attempts to direct him out of the enclosure by opening the gates to adjacent pools and cutting the net of the false bottom,
the animal expired. corrective action has since been implemented to minimize the risk of animal injury while handled for

measured 7 inches in height but there were several gaps especially around the waterers and the corners where the
height was as low as 2 inches in some areas.
inadequate wall heights below 7 inches may result in escape of guinea pigs from their enclosures and may lead to
injury during their escape or prevent access to food and water.

25324,"***there was a male basset hound (#0a02071869) with thick, green discharge covering both eyes. some of the
discharge was present in the fur surrounding both eyes. the surface of neither eyeball could be visualized through
the heavy amount of discharge present. the left eye also had a clump of thick, crusty material present with the
discharge located near the central portion of the upper eyelid. the licensee said the discharge in this dog's eyes
was something he would notice when it was cold out. according to the licensee, he had consulted with a
veterinarian regarding dogs at the facility with green eye discharge and would clean out their eyes and apply eye
drops as needed. however, the licensee said nothing had been done with this dog'(cid:25)s eyes today or yesterday and
he could not remember the last time he had needed to treat this dog's eyes. also, the licensee had not had this dog
examined or consulted with a veterinarian regarding the dog's current condition. during the inspection, the licensee
wiped out some of the green discharge mostly from the dog's right eye and some from the left eye with his hand.
the dog would frequently move its head from side to side while attempting to more closely observe the eyes. it
appeared that the left eye also had reddened tissue present (third eyelid) covering a small portion of the corner
surface of the eye. this dog's eye condition could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition.
the licensee agreed to have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than april 17, 2014 in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed. the licensee must
ensure that the treatment plan is followed. the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary
care at all times."

***in the outdoor facility, there were at least five enclosures containing at least twelve adult basset hounds, beagles
and boxers that had an excessive amount of feces. the licensee stated that these enclosures had not been cleaned
since 11/15/2014 due to the snowfall and freezing temperatures. accumulations of waste products increase the risk
of disease by attracting pests, soiling the animals and providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. the
licensee must remove the feces and assure that waste materials are removed from the primary enclosures daily, as

25505,"- the rhino barn was filled with an excessive amount of feces and urine. the droppings were soft and had spilled
out of the stalls and onto the outer perimeter of the barn, including the walkway between the stalls. droppings were
present on numerous stall bars, and the water troughs on one side of the barn were half full of an unidentifiable
liquid which did not appear to be water. the fecal matter had been present long enough for most of the surface to
be coated with a white, fuzzy growth which appeared to be mold. pools of standing urine were also present in the
stalls. on the outside of one stall, tracks of a small unknown animal were found imprinted in the puddle of feces.
the condition of this barn was absolutely unacceptable, and the rhino ""tank"" must not be allowed access to this
facility until it is thoroughly cleaned and properly sanitized. any animal exposed to this area would be at a severe
risk of contamination, both from the presence of the waste and from the suspected mold growth covering the pools
of fecal matter. since this barn is the only true shelter available to tank, the entire area must be cleaned and

drafts were measured with the kestrel 4000 that exceeded 3 miles per hour near the windows and exceeding 1 mile
per hour at the guinea pig enclosures nearest the windows. guinea pigs in the nearest enclosures were observed
huddling initially and later (once windows were closed) were observed grooming and engaged in other normal
behavior. in the afternoon when the windows were closed to increase the temperature and stop the drafts, the
ammonia smell increased in the guinea pig building. the strongest ammonia odors were present in the middle of the
building between rows 2 and 3. ammonia can irritate the eyes and respiratory tracts of the guinea pigs and cause
the animals to be more susceptible to eye and respiratory tract infections. additionally, significant drafts may result
in the development of multiple health problems. rows 2 and 3 were last cleaned on wednesday, november 12,
2014 and multiple enclosures contained wet bedding. more frequent bedding changes and cleaning are necessary

26882,"one goat who lives alone alongside the peccaries has overgrown rear claws. several aoudads have overgrown
hooves. the foot claws of one aoudad are so long they are slipper like with the front of the claw in the air and one
claw appears to be growing sideways. overgrown hooves can lead to abnormalities in the bones of the feet as they
can cause the toes to turn improperly. this can lead to lameness and be potentially painful. all animals needing
feet trimming need to have their hooves trimmed promptly and as frequently as necessary for foot health.
the two squirrel monkeys have severe hair loss and redness over their rear legs and most of their tails. one was
seen scratching excessively. both monkeys are thin. they are around 25 years old and have access to indoor and
outdoor enclosures as weather permits. the attending veterinarian has not evaluated these animals to try and find
out the reason for the fur and weight loss. because fur and weight loss can be a sign of an underlying medical
condition, these animals need to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian, and any medical conditions treated.
the 4 year old male lion appears to have incoordination in his rear legs. there is a slight swaying to his rear gait
and a swinging out of the legs as he moves. the hocks are abnormally dropped. abnormal rear limb movements in
lions can be a sign of nutritional deficiencies, parasitic diseases, or other illnesses. the attending veterinarian
needs to evaluate this animal to diagnose any underlying disease and provide treatments.
abnormal repetitive behaviors are observed for several animals. on the first day of inspection, one 14 year old male
american black bear walked the same small path repetitively for approximately two to three minutes. on the
second day of inspection, this bear was not seen to leave its den except for feeding. the other male bear in that
area was never seen out of its den during most of the two day inspection except for the feeding observed on the
second day. on several previous inspections this same bear was only seen in its den.
the young cougar exhibited abnormal pacing behavior during both inspection days. the same pacing pattern was
seen for several minutes both inspection days. the cougar was observed to show these behaviors from several
positions both within and out of the animal’s sight. her behavior was recorded on day one at 15:35 and day two at
17:37.
a male and a female hamadryas baboon housed in adjacent but separate enclosures both showed some repetitive
behaviors. on the first inspection day, the male was closed into his smaller enclosure and continuously circled. the
female is in estrus as evidenced by sexual swellings, and these animals are not paired to breed. on the second
day of inspection, the male baboon had access to the larger cage, but still repeatedly circled and made a figure
eight pacing pattern on the raised wooden boards at one end of the bigger enclosure. this pattern was only
interrupted when humans came into his line of sight, and resumed once they left his view. the female baboon
repetitively swayed back and forth on all fours in one spot on the floor of the enclosure for over 4 minutes. then
she stopped momentarily, then resumed the swaying. her behavior was recorded at two time periods (15:49 and
16:55).
abnormal behavior patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues that may require medical treatment
or habitat/husbandry modification, and must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to receive
appropriate treatment and management. medical treatments, including routine care, should be documented.
the attending veterinarian came during the inspection and briefly looked at the lion, baboons, two bears and
squirrel monkeys. the cited veterinary care issues were outlined for the attending veterinarian.

26890,"one adult female zebu and two adult llamas had significantly overgrown hooves. while the footpads of the llamas
were positioned and oriented normally, the toenails were noticeably overgrown. the hindlimb hooves of the female
zebu were also overgrown and longer than the forelimb hooves. the facility representative reported the llamas’
hooves are trimmed when they are sheared annually to avoid immobilizing and sedating them more than once.
they also stated the zebu’s hoof trimming was postponed due to recent inclement weather.
overgrown hooves can lead to deformities in the bones of the feet as they can alter the conformation of the toes,
causing the toes to turn inappropriately. this can lead to pain and potential lameness. all animals needing feet
trimming should have their hooves trimmed in a timely manner, and as frequently as necessary for foot health."
26896,"two adult llamas had noticeably overgrown hooves. although the llamas’ forelimb footpads maintained their normal
positioning and placement, the toenails were strikingly overgrown, deviating to the side. the facility representative stated
the llamas’ hooves had not been trimmed due to recent weather conditions, as they’ve been waiting for drier
accommodations at the facility.
overgrown hooves can lead to pain, discomfort, and subsequent lameness. under chronic conditions, the conformation of

***there was an adult female boxer (id # 010 815-067), which was nursing eight puppies approximately 3 1/2
weeks of age, who was very thin. the dog's ribs, spine and hip bones were easily visualized from a distance. at the
time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted regarding this dog(cid:25)s condition nor was the dog
receiving treatment for it. poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other
underlying medical problems.
the licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding these animals(cid:25) conditions in order to ensure that
accurate diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed. the licensee must ensure that the
treatment plans are followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

large felids are not wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination or nutritive value to maintain these animals
in good health.
1) the otters have recently stopped eating this old fish and given a diet of chicken and pork. these river otters are
known to eat mainly fish in the wild and some crustaceans, mollusks, insects, birds, oysters, shellfish, crabs,
crayfish, frogs, rodents, turtles and aquatic invertebrate and now given chicken and pork. the change in the otters
diet shall be prepared with consideration for the species and approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure its an
adequate diet. the mullet in an uncovered box had dry outside surfaces, cloudy eyes, soft when touch and foul
odor. it was stated that the fish were in the freezer one week, however the condition of the mullet appears this fish
had been thawed more than the two days in insufficient temperatures of 32 f to 45 f, that was recorded during this
inspection. fish should be fed to these otters after being thawed 24 hours or discarded.
2) the ground beef was thawed, brown in color, and i was able to push my fingers from the plastic wrapping. this
ground beef has been stored at insufficient temperatures for at least several days or more and appears obtained
prior to the other meats.

according to the curator was just obtained several days ago. the curator stated that the walk in freezer would be
repaired the day after this inspection which would be at least 3 days with possible insufficient refrigeration. any
meats that are spoiled should not be use and once thawed shall not be frozen again.
proper temperatures in refrigerated and freezer spaces should be—
freezer: –22 to 0 f) refrigerator: 40 to 43 f.
4) the tigers and lions are currently eating chicken and pork with a supplement, but no longer given beef which
was a part of their diet approved by the attending veterinarian. all diets need to be followed and the diet for the
overweight male adult white tiger needs to be reviewed by the attending veterinarian to ensure that its a complete
nutritional diet.
5) this facility is in the process of breeding their large felids, however there is no diet available if cubs would be
unable to feed from their mother. often there are issues with the mother feeding her cubs, so there must be a
written alternative diet available.

30443,"on august 6th, discussions with the attending veterinarian (av) for this facility revealed that she did not have experience
treating exotic species beyond small pocket pets such as guinea pigs and ferrets. after inspectors explained the role and
responsibilities of an attending veterinarian for usda licensed facilities, the av expressed concern over her ability and
availability to continue as the attending. the av repeatedly said she was not comfortable treating exotic animals. per her
explanation, she had not received training or had experience in the care and management of the various exotic species
present at the auction. she also commented that it would be unlikely she could be available to attend to veterinary care
needs for the entire duration of the auction (tuesday-sunday).
furthermore, the av was unsure of her responsibilities and role as the facility’s attending veterinarian. she explained that
the facility’s office manager had given her a blank program of veterinary care and a blue book without further
explanation. additionally, the office manager had not explained the av’s role at the facility. inspectors found that the av
had not physically examined the animals in the “warm room” and most of the animals in the auction barn pens beyond a
few individual animals requiring health certificates. she was unaware she was allowed to do so.
during a walk through of the barn pens with the av, a female camel was identified by inspectors as a concern due to the
presence of an open draining abscess on her right mammary gland. the office manager was contacted as well as the
owner of the camel. the owner of the camel requested that the av treat her with an antibiotic, draxxin. inspectors
witnessed the av admitting that she did not know the proper dosage for a camel. the owner of the camel instructed the
av to dose the camel the same as a cow and provided her the animal’s approximate weight. the office manager also
approved of the suggestion by the camel owner. when inspectors requested that the temperature of the camel be taken
prior to receiving the antibiotic, the av admitted that she did not have a thermometer and did not feel comfortable taking
the camel’s temperature. the office manager and owner offered to locate and provide a thermometer with the statement
that the av would not have to do “any hands-on work” on the animal.
inspectors were unable to review the program of veterinary care due to a refusal of inspection by the office manager on
august 7th. lack of a valid program of veterinary care and an attending veterinarian with training and/or experience in the
care and management of the exotic species present at this auction puts animals at risk for improper treatment of disease
and injury. additionally, it can lead to suffering and death. the licensee must have an attending veterinarian who shall
provide adequate veterinary care to its animals. the attending veterinarian must have received training and/or experience

manager, inspectors requested that the animal’s temperature be taken. the av admitted she did not have a thermometer
on hand or in her truck. the office manager and the camel’s owner both offered to locate and/or buy a thermometer for
the av’s use however the camel’s antibiotic treatment would likely be given prior to taking its temperature. failure to

had large holes chewed through the wood. the last pen in the barn contained 2 adult dogs with 1 shelter structure
and there was a hole approximately the size of a basketball chewed through the wall near the floor of the shelter.
the shelter structure was not under the barn overhang and therefore not protected from the weather. the open pen
directly outside the back of the barn contained 5 adults dogs with 2 shelter structures and there was a hole
approximately the size of a banana in the roof of 1 shelter, where it joined the wall. the shelter was under a shade
tree but had no other protective barrier over it. in the early morning hours of the day of inspection, a severe storm
had passed over and it had rained approximately an inch in this area. the holes were large enough that the shelters
no longer provided the dogs with adequate protection from the direct effect of wind or rain. shelters that are large

coax gina to the heated barn and gina collapsed. the licensee got gina up again and she collapsed again and
could not get up. the licensee had to wait until the neighbor got home, the licensee stated 15-20 minutes, to carry
gina to the barn. at that time the licensee covered gina with towels and gave her an injection of penicillin. the
licensee went back to the barn the next morning at approximately 8:30 am and found gina dead. the licensee then
called the attending veterinarian at 8:47 am. the licensee stated to me that she was following the protocol set forth
by her attending veterinarian. i asked to see the protocol to which she was referring. the licensee provided a
protocol that the veterinarian had established for ""mild skin abrasions or superficial wounds"". the licensee stated
she didn't understand what that meant and thought she could treat the dog on her own.
each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnose and treat injuries with provisions made for emergencies.
the license must take all animals that are in need of veterinary care to a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment. if the licensee does not understand the terminology used in the program of veterinary
care, such as “mild skin abrasions or superficial wounds”, it is the responsibility of the licensee to ask for
clarification from the attending veterinarian so that they have a good understanding of the terms. because the
licensee did not follow the veterinary care guidelines this dog suffered from serious injuries. this dog suffered and

on the morning of september 1, 2017, approximately 22 turkey poults in one housing room were found dead by the
caretaker. according to the caretaker, several other poults appeared to be severely depressed at that time. over
the next 24 to 48 hours, several other poults died. the daily observation (ncah animal care and use log sheets)
sheet posted on the animal housing room door stated that a total of 38 died during this incident.

september 1st when it was noted the room was 64°f in the morning when the caretakers arrived to find the dead
birds. the caretaker stated that this room is normally maintained at a temperature of approximately 72°f. these
birds are maintained in this room with two heat lamps. additionally, the facility was not monitoring the temperatures

housing temperature surrounding the brooding areas that allow birds to move toward or away from a separate heat
source (such as heat lamps) should be maintained at 68 to 77°f (ag guide pg 116).

dry, dark, shanks (dehydration – picture). 4/4 empty crops. 4/4 atrophied intestines with enlarged gall bladder…” a
feed sample was also submitted with results pending.
thermoregulatory mechanisms are poorly developed in poults (ag guide pg 116) making adequate ambient
temperatures important for their health and comfort. also, the necropsy report suggests lack of nutrition (inanition).

one juvenile african crested porcupine housed at the facility did not have access to water. the facility representative
stated that the animals are offered water around noon each day. the facility representative was asked by the inspectors
to provide water to the animal. the juvenile african crested porcupine was found to be excessively thirsty. the animal
drank voraciously for approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds and only stopping when being disturbed by human activity
in the room. the porcupine knocked over the water bowl and continued drinking the spilled water from the floor of the
enclosure.
the eagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered indicates that the animals are extremely thirsty,

34419,"during inspection, a goat kid escaped from its enclosure. the goat kid went underneath the woven wire fencing. the
bottom fencing along the entirety of the enclosure is loose and curls under. the facility representative reports that the goat
kid does this a lot but never goes far because it won’t leave the mother goat. the goat kid returned to the enclosure on its
own by crawling underneath the fencing after approximately 5 minutes.
there is a wooden play structure in the goat and sheep enclosure. on one platform, there is a missing section of a
wooden board with two exposed nail heads remaining. the missing section is approximately 1.5 feet in length. there is an
approximately 5 feet drop to the ground underneath the play structure.
woven wire fencing between the camel and camelid (two llamas and one alpaca) enclosures is bent and sagging. the
affected area is located near the corner of the barn. the top part of the fencing is affected, approximately 4 feet in length.
there is an exposed nail head in one post.
there are three unprotected, loose, and hanging electrical cords in the sloth enclosure (the sloth was in an enclosure with
an iguana). one is attached to an unplugged heat lamp on the ceiling. there is an orange extension cord plugged into a
socket but is not powering anything (it is meant to attach to the free end of the heat lamp). the last electrical cord is
attached to a heater on the right side of the enclosure.
the situations above indicate potential hazards to the animals housed within the enclosures. rotted, broken boards;
loose, sagging fencing; and loose, uncovered electrical cords that animals can come into contact with increase the
potential for serious injury, such as electrocution, entanglement/entrapment, lacerations or puncture wounds, and falling.
animals that can escape their enclosure are at risk for trauma, ingestion of poisonous materials, theft, loss, and death.
the facility is responsible for constructing enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair so as to
protect animals from injury and also safely contain the animals. correct by ensuring that enclosures undergo regular
maintenance as often as necessary for the upkeep of structural integrity, that fencing is strong and appropriate for the

kangaroo has not been recovered at this time.
the stall in the barn was a standard horse stall with wooden sides, located in the corner of the barn, and the
licensee had placed an additional panel over the stall door to increase the height of the door. the side wall of the
stall was approximately 5 feet tall. the main barn does not have a door, and there is no fence between the barn and
the road, thus the animal was able to escape from the premises after getting out of the stall.
animals that escape may suffer from lack of food and water, exposure to harsh weather, and injury from cars or wild

34481,"on the morning of october 5th, 2020, an approximately 8.5- to 9-week old male oriental small-clawed otter pup was
found dead in its enclosure. the licensee stated that the day before, the pup had been used in 12 to 15 public encounters.
encounters are advertised as lasting 30 minutes, but the licensee stated that they usually lasted 5 to 15 minutes each.
during public encounters, members of the public could hold and play with the otter pup. the licensee stated that the otter
pup appeared to be normal and had a normal appetite the evening before it died. the licensee stated that after
discovering the dead pup he contacted the attending veterinarian, and both he and the veterinarian believe that the pup
died as a result of stress from the previous day’s public encounters and handling. the attending veterinarian was
contacted and confirmed this conclusion.
young otter pups can be easily stressed. behavioral or psychological stress can occur due to separation from the mother
otter and litter mates, as otters are known to be highly social animals. stress to the body can occur easily: due to their
small size and young age, otter pups can easily become dehydrated, injured, exhausted, or cold. the excitation and
activity caused by public encounters can also lead to low blood sugar, which can be deadly. prolonged stress can lead to
decreased function of the immune system, increased susceptibility to infections, increased risk of diarrhea, and reduced
growth.

34485,"8 small ruminants were reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet, and 2 additional small ruminants
had severely overgrown hooves. these animals are described below:
1) a dark brown adult neutered male goat was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the left front foot, right front foot, and
right hind foot. the animal was reluctant to get up and walk, and the right hind and left front feet appeared to be swollen.
the animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. the owner stated that he had treated the animal with la-200
(antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) treatment from the feed store, and that the last treatment had been given was on
sunday (march 7th). the owner stated that the lameness just got bad this past weekend, and that the animal had been
treated for this condition before.
2) a black and white intact male goat, ear tag #015, was reluctant to bear weight on both front feet, which appeared to be
swollen. the animal was observed to have difficulty laying down and was seen to balance on his front knees with his head
down. the animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. the owner stated that he had treated the animal with la-
200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on treatment, and that the last treatment was administered 6 days ago (march 3rd).
3) a black and white intact male sheep was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the right front foot, which appeared to
be swollen. the owner stated that this animal had been fine on sunday, when it had been used for a petting zoo, and he
had not yet treated this animal for the lameness. the animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.
4) a small light brownish red female goat had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs, and was reluctant to bear
weight on the right front foot. the goat was in thin body condition and had a tucked abdomen. the hooves on the back
legs were so overgrown they were curving upwards and causing the back feet to be in an abnormal position. the owner
stated that he had plans to trim the back feet and treat the right front foot for foot scald. the owner stated that this animal
hasn't been lame on sunday.
5) a white dorset adult female sheep had severely overgrown hooves on all four feet. the hooves were approximately
1.5-2x the normal length. the animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.
6) an adult white female sheep was lame on the left back leg. the animal had two lambs on her and a full udder and
appeared to be in normal body condition. the owner stated that he had not treated her.
7) a small male white and brown goat kid was reluctant to bear weight on the right front leg and the owner stated that he
had not been treated yet. the owner stated that this animal was not lame on sunday.
8) a grey and white adult female goat was lame on the right front foot. the owner stated that she had been treated with
la-200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) medication on sunday.
9) a small young black male goat kid, the offspring of the grey and white female above (#8), was extremely reluctant to
bear weight on the left hind leg. the kid also had mild brown crusts around the nose and eyes. the owner stated that this
kid had been given a dose of la-200 (antibiotic) on sunday.
10) a black and white goat in the deer enclosure had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs. the animal appeared
to be in normal body condition.
the facility owner stated that the attending veterinarian had instructed him to treat foot scald in goats with la-200
(antibiotic injection) and copper tox (topical medication), but he had not been using copper tox in part of concern about
copper toxicity in sheep. instead, the facility owner had been using injectable la-220 and a topical product for foot
disease from the feed store, the name of which he could not recall and which was unavailable at the time of inspection.
animals that are reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet may suffer from pain or discomfort, and
the condition may hinder an animal’s ability or willingness to walk or run, to rest comfortably, and to access food, water,
and shelter. the presence of severely overgrown hooves puts abnormal stress and strain on the hoof (foot) which can
cause injury, inflammation, or dysfunction.

34661,"on 9/25/19 seven ring-tail lemurs that ranged in ages from 7 months to 5 years were inappropriately handled that
resulted in the death of one adult male lemur. the licensee's employee moved the lemurs from their primary
enclosures and loaded the animals into plastic crates where they stayed for 1.5 to 3 hours awaiting pick up by the
buyer. according to the ranch manager and the primary caretaker, one adult male lemur was discovered in serious
condition at the time when the animal was removed from the facility’s holding plastic crate and transferred to the
buyers crate. he was suffering from multiple fight/bite wounds. large wounds were present on the thigh, forearm,
inguinal area, testicle and the skull was described as exposed with a wound that extended down the neck. the tail
was also broken.
multiple lemurs were placed in single crates. the 3 crates each measured 24""l x 20”w x 23”h for a total of 3.33
square feet per crate. this is an inadequate amount of space for multiple lemurs (group 2 species) to be housed or
transported together. furthermore, the primary caretaker who captured and moved the lemurs on 9/25/19 said he
was unaware of the genders or ages of the lemurs and did not know what genders were placed with the injured
male. the ranch manager and animal caretaker stated the animals were checked on several times after being
placed in the crates and appeared to be calm.
the injured lemur died a few days later as a result of the trauma. immediate veterinary care was provided by the
licensee’s veterinarian and a few days later the wounds required additional surgical repair by the buyer’s
veterinarian.
these lemurs were handled in a manner that was not as expeditiously or as carefully as possible to prevent trauma
or unnecessary discomfort. disrupting the social group and housing animals of mix ages and unknown genders is
likely to cause aggression between primates. compounding this by housing them in crowded confinement for
several hours further increased the behavioral stress (increasing the likelihood of serious injury). as a result of this
inappropriate handling, this male lemur experienced significant pain and distress later dying as a result of the
trauma. animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible that does not cause trauma or
unnecessary discomfort.

35562,"during the inspection, one female german shepherd ""sophie"" was observed favoring the left hind limb, reluctant to put
weight on it when standing and a slight limp while walking. the skin between her foot pad and toes in this area was red on
initial inspection, but returned to white after several minutes spent inside on a dry floor - the redness may have been due
to cold, wet conditions when she was outside. however, there remained a swelling in the main paw pad and a whitish
thickened line of tissue where the pad meets the skin, as well as a yellowish scab-like material at the point of the pad.
this condition is painful and causes difficulty maneuvering in her enclosure. the written program of veterinary care does
not address this specific condition, and the licensee had not noticed it prior to the inspection. he provided a treatment
prescribed for minor abrasions during the inspection.

in the waste trough under the plastic coated metal grate flooring.
*** in building 96, room 6, approximately 50% of the solid-floored whelping kennels had areas of chipped and peeling
paint and exposed concrete on the back wall of the kennel. the kennels have a nesting area in the rear by the wall with
bedding where the puppies stay. the areas of flaking paint are low on the wall and adjacent to the area used by the
animals.
*** throughout buildings g1, g2, and g3 there are several areas of chipped concrete around the edge of the hole that
provides access between the inside and outside areas of each kennel. some of the chipped concrete creates gaps about
½ inch to 1 inch in size between the concrete and the metal flashing of the door frame. areas with chunks of concrete

manager stated that the animal enclosures in the whelping area are only sanitized between litters (approximately every 6
weeks). the facility operations manager stated that while cages and runs are in use, they are spot cleaned daily or as
needed using a degreaser (gp-100) which does not have disinfection properties.
the second cleaning procedure, “general husbandry of the whelping area” (egs-sop-prd-6521) states that cages are
scrubbed daily with a disinfectant. however, the facility operations manager stated that employees currently use gp-100
as a degreaser to clean cages, but this product is not a disinfectant. the water temperature used for cleaning is not
specified or monitored/recorded. the facility operations manager stated that cages and runs in the whelping area are
disinfected in between litters (approximately every 6 weeks).
buildings g1, g2, and g3 are cleaned in accordance with the procedure for “sanitation methods and frequency of
indoor/outdoor facilities using the landa stationary pressure washer” (egs-sop-prd-6526). that sop states that
indoor/outdoor runs are cleaned with 180 degree fahrenheit water at least every two weeks, but there is no detergent or
soap utilized in this cleaning process. the facility operations manager stated that the degreaser (gp-100) used elsewhere

36411,"***in building 97, room 15, at 1:36 pm on 07/20/21, a 3-week-old male puppy was found in the pan below cage # 97-11-
15. the puppy was huddled, depressed and not actively vocalizing or searching for his dam. he had dried excreta in his
fur. when handled he remained listless and quiet. upon removing the puppy from the pan and replacing him into the cage
above, with his dam (chbcmx), he immediately began crawling towards the rest of the litter. according to the facility
operations manager, the room had been cleaned around 9 am that morning and this puppy belonged in the cage above
the tray where he was found. the facility operations manager indicated that this puppy must have fallen into the tray
during the morning cleaning. there are no gaps or areas where the puppy could fall out of the cage when the cage door is
closed. the puppy was immediately examined and treated by the attending veterinarian.
young puppies who fall into trays below their cage may become distressed, cold, hungry, dehydrated, or contaminated
with feces and urine.
correct by july 23rd, 2021 by ensuring all puppies are handled expeditiously and carefully in a manner that does not
cause excessive cooling, behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort. this noncompliance was discussed with facility
management and the facility took steps to address this issue immediately.
***13 nursing adult female beagles, housed in individual cages with their litters of 6-week old puppies (78 total), were
fasted for 42 hours. the facility representatives stated that this reduces milk production and is part of their current
standard operating procedure for weaning which they believe reduces the risk of mastitis. this was conducted in
accordance with the facility’s “weaning of puppies” procedure (egs-sop-prd-6616). metal automatic food dispensers
(self-feeders) which were normally mounted on the doors of each cage were turned around and left on the doors of the
cage, so that the dogs could see and smell the food but could not eat it. many of these self-feeders did not have lids, so
the dog food was visible through the uncovered top of the feeders. food access was removed on monday (07/19/21) after
noon, and food access was returned to the dogs on wednesday (07/21/21) beginning around 6am when the females
were separated from their litters and moved to a different housing area. the inspectors initially observed the dogs at
approximately 12pm on tuesday, 7/20/21. three dams were observed to be reaching their front paws through the doors
of the cages to reach the food in the top of their feeders, these dogs were seen trying to scoop or dig out food from the
feeders but could only retrieve the occasional piece of kibble. one dam was observed to be vigorously licking the back of
the self-feeder, another was observed intently smelling the side of the feeder.
deprivation of food causes stress, hunger, and anxiety. placing the food where it can be seen, smelled, and in some
cases touched by dogs while the dogs are fasting is causing unnecessary distress and anxiety.
correct by july 23rd, 2021 by ensuring that dogs are handled in a manner that does not cause unnecessary discomfort
and/or behavioral stress. this noncompliance was discussed with facility management at the time of initial observation on
tuesday 7/20/2021."
36416,"daily observation failed to identify 15 dogs with medical issues prior to the inspection. a treatment plan was created for
each of these dogs following identification by aphis inspectors, however, there are currently not sufficient employees to
recognize these issues effectively. daily observations regarding veterinary care are made by 6 trained staff members
who conduct daily observation in addition to other duties including treatments and husbandry; 3-4 of these employees
conduct daily observations each day.
several animals were found in need of critical care. this included the puppy found by inspectors under the enclosure in
the tray used for urine and feces collection and the adult dog with the toes entrapped in the slat flooring. although both
animals received care immediately, they were not identified by animal care staff responsible for providing husbandry care.
two cage cards, and one puppy, were missing from nursery cages. sheltered housing facilities were not being managed
in accordance with the written temperature sop. the facility currently employs 39 personnel for over 5000 dogs, and
there are 5 vacancies which remain unfilled.

compliances identified during that inspection. an additional inspection report will be delivered with the other issues
identified during this inspection.
this inspection was conducted with the manager of operations and attending veterinarian. the exit briefing was
conducted on july 22nd, 2021 with the manager of operations, the attending veterinarian, the senior vice president for

36421,"animals have not been handled as carefully and expeditiously as possible leading to subsequent death.
*** according to the manager of operations, a newborn puppy was found in the drains below the kennels on 10-13-2021.
the manager of operations explained that the facility had recently laid down a new type of flooring on top of the existing
kennel grate to enhance puppy safety. the manager believes that the puppy fell into the drain because one dam
(ckjcct) had shifted a piece of the flooring, exposing a gap, and whelped on top of the old flooring. the puppy was
found between 1-2 pm and immediately brought to the clinic for a bath and was returned to the above dam who had
recently whelped near where the puppy was found. the puppy was also provided supplemental heat but died later that
day. the manager of operations stated that in response to this incident, employees replaced the flooring and added
paper to the back of the kennels to prevent another occurrence.
*** mortality records show that a 7-week-old puppy (clicbe) was found deceased on 21 oct 2020 with its head stuck in
the swinging kennel door of a bedded whelping run. facility representatives state that an investigation of the incident was
completed at the time, but they do not have access to the files from previous management. it was determined that the
entrapment and subsequent death was a result of employee error. the employee has since been terminated. failure to
handle animals as carefully and expeditiously as possible can lead to injury or death. employees must take special care
when working with small puppies as they are more easily overlooked and seriously injured. the licensee must ensure all
animals are handled expeditiously and carefully in a manner that does not cause physical harm, trauma, or unnecessary
discomfort.

36425,"the facility is still having compatibility issues between dogs housed in groups.
october 26, 2021:
***two adult female beagles (cibctg and cjacnf) being housed together had scabs covering multiple small puncture
wounds/scrapes. cibctg had hair loss present on her back midline and wounds located on her right nose, right ear, left
ear, and left cheek. after replacing cibctg in the kennel, she began biting and chasing her kennel mate (cjacnf).
cjacnf had scabs/wounds on her right knee and inner left thigh. the biting and wounds had not been previously
identified by the facility. when questioned, the facility stated that cibctg is currently in heat and may be picking fights
with her kennel mates. when inspectors identified this issue, the facility representatives removed cibctg and placed her
in a separate kennel. no steps have been implemented at the facility to prevent potential compatibility issues.
***two adult female beagles were currently being treated for fight wounds that occurred on 10/25/2021. an adult female
beagle (cjacri) had fight wounds on her chest and left ear. the other adult female beagle (cgfcfa) had fight wounds
on her rear end and right front shoulder. these dogs were removed from two different kennels subsequent to fights which
resulted in these injuries. according to the facility representative, following a fight, the injured animal is removed and
treated medically. once they are healed, the animal is relocated to a new enclosure in the attempt to find more compatible
kennel mates. if one dog is found to be involved in multiple fights and thought to be the aggressor, they may elect to
euthanize due to temperament. there is currently no systematic pro-active attempt to identify incompatible animals
through behavioral observation; rather, dogs are moved only after injuries are sustained.
***facility records also show on 10/14/2021, a female dog cmhcac was found dead. the mortality log and mortality
record sheet from october 14th attributed the dog’s death to evisceration (evis). cmhcac was being cohoused with 9
other dogs approximately the same age (10 weeks old). according to the facility, the dog was found dead and the
“littermates had chewed on it.” the facility was unable to provide additional information when asked. there is no
description of the lesions identified other than the facility code “evis” and no record of post-mortem examination findings.
when inspectors asked to talk to the employee that found this puppy dead, they were informed she was unreachable due
to leave. dogs attacking/chewing on another dog, whether alive or deceased, is an uncommon behavior for dogs with
adequate nutrition and likely indicates a compatibility issue.
even though this facility continues to have compatibility problems in their group housed animals, there has been no action
taken by the facility to proactively identify and potentially house separately those dogs that are incompatible or have an
aggressive disposition. failure to maintain compatible groups of dogs can lead to injuries, pain, and even death in the
dogs. correct this by ensuring all dogs are maintained in compatible groups."
36434,"on 11/16/21, 21 puppies were found to be handled in a manner that they were damp, shivering, and cold in building g3.
according to facility records, 25 additional puppies had been found dead with cause of death attributed to cold exposure
in building g3 over the last 8 weeks.

g3 room 2 enclosures #43, 54, & 72 housed 5- to 7-week-old puppies without dams. the enclosures had all recently
been cleaned with cold water and kennels were not dried prior to replacing puppies. these enclosures were on the side of
the room opposite the radiant heater. none of these enclosures had any solid resting surface or bedding. no heat lamps
were present in room 1. enclosures in room 2 had heat lamps which were present, but not plugged in at the time of
inspection. on 11/19/21 bldg g3, room 1 was re-checked and there were still no heat lamps installed. again, several
puppies were observed shivering.
all handling of animals, including cleaning activities and housing, must be done as carefully and expeditiously as possible
and in a manner that does not cause excessive cooling. allowing puppies to become wet and chilled during / following
cleaning or not providing sufficient heating/bedding causes discomfort and may result in illness or death. correct by
ensuring that all animals are handled as carefully and expeditiously as possible and in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort."
36440,"multiple dogs do not have adequate protection from the elements within their shelter due to missing access door flaps.
enclosure in g1 & g2 are constructed with openings in the back wall to allow the dogs to move between the indoor and
outdoor portions of the enclosure. several enclosures are missing the flap which covers this egress opening. this allows
extreme weather, such as frigid temperatures, to enter the sheltered portion. while a guillotine type door is present, this
door is only closed during cleaning and is left open overnight and most of the day providing no break from wind.
numerous other enclosures have flaps severely damaged by chewing; in those enclosures, 50-75% of the flap is missing
leaving it similarly ineffective at providing shelter. during the week of the inspection, overnight temperatures fell to the low
20s and 30s fahrenheit. enclosures with missing flaps housed at least 9 dogs while those with severely damaged flaps
housed many more. dogs in adjacent enclosures were likely exposed to drafts as well.
failure to fully protect the sheltered portion of the enclosure may not allow the dogs to completely escape extreme
weather conditions which can result in discomfort or illness. the licensee must repair or replace these flaps in order to
provide adequate shelter from the elements including protection from freezing temperatures. to be corrected by: 11 feb

lethargic, depressed behavior could be an indication that an animal is ill and feeling unwell. during the inspection of the
facility on july 29, 2021, the licensee stated to the inspectors that this site has experienced confirmed positive cases of
parvovirus in several of their dogs throughout the month of july. discharge from the nose, abnormal body temperatures,

36674,"female golden retriever (tag #801, ear tattoo #101, microchip #990000005953800) had a surgical procedure performed
on her abdomen, but the inspector is unable to determine if the procedure is compliant with the requirements to provide
the animal with adequate veterinary care.
the dog was sold by the licensee through an auction on august 20th. the individual who purchased the animal
transported it to a licensed veterinarian the next morning after noticing the dog had an incision in its abdomen that was
reddened and inflamed. two licensed veterinarians examined the dog and found it to have an abdominal incision that
was 5 to 8 days old which was sutured with fishing line. both veterinarians concluded that due to the appearance of the
incision along with the inappropriate suturing material, that this procedure had not been performed by a licensed
veterinarian and appeared to be done by someone who had no skill in surgery. the veterinarians also diagnosed the dog
with pyometra resulting in the animal being spayed.
the inspector spoke with an individual who attended the auction and was present when this dog was sold. the individual
said that during the sale of this dog a question was asked about the dog having a c-section scar on her abdomen and the
licensee responded that the dog was bred and stated, ""we removed her uterus, implanted it, and put it back in"". when
the inspector asked the licensee about this statement, he said it was a lie.
the inspector requested medical records and information from the licensee's kennel manager concerning this dog, but the
manager had no records for this animal. the licensee also told the inspector numerous different stories pertaining to this
dog, which were often contradictory such as the dog had a c-section in june, then decided he didn’t know when the dog
had last whelped, then said the dog had a c-section around july 18th, but then stated at the auction that the dog was
bred. the licensee also told the inspector many times that he didn’t know who performed the surgical procedure on the
animal, but then said the attending veterinarian had done a c-section. the inspector contacted the licensee's attending
veterinarian requesting any medical records and information in regard to this dog, but the inspector received no reply.
the failure to provide accurate information has interfered in the ability of the inspector to determine exactly when the
medical procedure was performed, if the procedure was performed by a qualified individual and if the procedure and
materials used were appropriate in regard to providing adequate veterinary care.
each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. the licensee
must ensure that all medical procedures are performed by qualified personnel and all methods and materials used are
appropriate to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

37189,"an adult male bullmastiff died acutely during transport in september 2021. the transporter stated to the inspectors that
the animal was secured in a plastic crate behind the driver when she heard him gasping and struggling to breathe. the
transporter did not stop right away for unclear reasons relating to being “on a one lane road in a construction zone”. she
claims that when she did find a place to stop, she removed the dog from his crate but he died shortly thereafter. she
admits the dog was wearing a slip choke chain collar but claims that the collar was not caught on anything. she stated
that this occurred late at night and that the dog had fans and air conditioning to maintain temperature. the transporter
stated that she doesn’t know what happened, and has no explanation for the animal’s death. this description of the
events does not correspond at all to what she initially told the owner of the animal. post-mortem veterinary findings
provided by the owner of the dog include a swollen, congested head with blood pouring from the mouth and nostrils.
based on the inconsistencies and vague details of her story, veterinary findings, and the admission that animal was
wearing a choke type collar inside the crate it seems likely that the dog’s death was due to a handling failure involving the
collar being trapped in some manner, resulting in the strangulation of the animal. these types of collars should not be left
on an animal in a transport crate. dogs must be handled carefully in a manner that does not cause stress, overheating, or
physical harm to the animal.

- a blue and gold macaw named gigi had several black and white clumps of fecal mixed with urinary waste attached to
the vent. the feathers around the area were stained with a greyish/white chalky substance.
- numerous black specks were seen on the neck, below the chin of one of the four coati. a flea like insect was also seen
moving along the fur in that area. a similar insect was seen between the fur on the back of another coati. two of the
animals were seen chewing at their tale and scratching their back as well as side during inspection.
the licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these animals prior to the inspection, so the veterinarian had not
been contacted. failure to promptly identify such conditions delays appropriate treatment and may cause undue
discomfort to the animals. direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely
diagnosis and adequate medical attention."

enough nesting material provided. there were a few straw pieces but almost the entirety of the floor of the nest box was
exposed with no substrate. not providing adequately clean and dry bedding, can cause the kits to be cold, stressed and
thereby more prone to disease, sickness, and death. nest boxes are necessary to provide the young offspring a clean

having been built as enrichment for the goats. the structure had dirt hoof marks on it, showing that the goats were using
it. the structure was hot to the touch, as my hand could not be placed on the object longer than a few seconds without
causing pain/burning. the metal easily retains heat, and consequently poses a hazard to the well-being of these animals

her arms as it was very hot to the touch. an infrared gun was then used to check the surface temperature of the metal in
the enclosure at the level of the animals, where the readings ranged between 143-147 degrees fahrenheit, which at
these temperatures could burn/injure them. the facility must be constructed of such material as appropriate for the
animals involved, and the indoor and outdoor facilities must be structurally sound and maintained to protect the animals

facility was found to be excessively thirsty. the animal drank voraciously for approximately 2 minutes and 42 seconds and
only stopping when being disturbed by human activity in the room. the eagerness and length of time spent consuming
water when offered indicates that the animals are extremely thirsty, and that the current schedule for watering is not
sufficient to meet the animals’ basic needs. frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of
the animal. the facility must provide water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. correct by 27-

38331,"the sloth is currently being housed in an enclosure near the front of the pet store. the enclosure has open viewing to the
public on all four sides of the enclosure. the enclosure provides no area in which the sloth can remove itself from public
view. constant exposure to the public with no opportunity to escape the close vicinity of the public can be very stressful
to the sloth. the sloth is exposed to drafts when the front door of the pet store is open. the humidity level as measured
with a kestrel was 40%. this is well below the 60% to 80% that sloths require. the drafty conditions and low humidity
can contribute to the discomfort of this animal and be detrimental to its health. the sloth enclosure is brightly lit with
overhead florescent lights. bright lights can be blinding to the sloth and may have contributed to the bite incident. the
enclosure is lacking an appropriate substrate and a central climbing structure. there is no basking light and no platforms
nooks or hammocks to provide appropriate resting areas. lack of these items can contribute to behavioral stress and
unnecessary discomfort for this sloth. provide appropriate housing conditions for this sloth.

large enough to house all lemurs during severe weather and does not provide adequate protection from rain, hail or other
severe weather.
-the capuchin’s enclosure has very limited, inadequate shade provisions. the enclosure is exposed to direct sun from
about 11 am until late afternoon. during inspection at about 2 pm, only about an 18-20-inch-wide band of the enclosure
was out of the sun on a day that the temperature was recorded at 93f.
not providing protection from high heat and humidity and severe weather can put the animals’ health at significant risk.

38572,"handling of animals during a public exhibition was not conducted as carefully as possible resulting in a 12-year old child
being bitten by a sugar glider during an interactive experience. the gliders arrived at the facility on 3/20/23 and were
between 16-18 weeks old on the day of the incident (5/13/23). according to facility personnel the staff member followed
their standard process for a glider interaction. this included taking all 5 gliders out of their pouch/sack for each interaction.
there is only one staff member present during the interaction and the single staff member is responsible for handling and
monitoring the 5 gliders, as well as responsible for monitoring the actions and behavior of the guests who participate in
the interaction (varies from 1 guest up to 3 or 4; 2 guests participated in the 5/13/23 interaction). the guests are seated
on a bench inside the exhibit and the staff member takes the 5 gliders out of the pouch/sack and places them on and near
the guests. the animals are then allowed to freely run over the guests for a period of time. during the interactive exhibit
on 5/13/23, the guest was bitten by the glider when they closed their hands and squeezed the glider when it was moving
across their hands.
handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. sugar gliders are small pocket-sized
tree-dwelling nocturnal animals that move quickly, are active at night, and sleep during the day. members of the public,
especially children, can easily become startled or frightened by the quick movements of these animals. similarly, sugar
gliders, particularly juvenile animals, may become startled and bite when not handled properly by inexperienced members
of the public. the presence of only a single staff member with responsibility for monitoring both the behavior of 5 animals
and the actions of multiple guests during an interaction, means that the staff would not be likely to intervene to protect the
animals or guests if something goes wrong. this is not handling the animals as carefully as possible or ensure the safety
of the animals and the public. following the bite, the staff member reported that they were unsure which of the five gliders
used in the interaction had bitten the guest. as a result, all 5 animals were quarantined by state health officials.
failure to handle animals as carefully as possible can result in behavioral stress, physical harm, and/or unnecessary
discomfort to the animals, and can result in injury to members of the public. correct by ensuring that all animals are
handled as carefully as possible by ensuring that an adequate number of staff are present to monitor the actions of the
animals and members of the public during animal interactions. correct from this date 6/2/23 forward."
38585,"in all of the sloth enclosures, the temperature and humidity monitor was not within the parameters set by the facility. the
humidity recorded on the kestrel in each of the sloth enclosures ranged from 46%-55%. sloths as a species are very
sensitive to temperature and humidity, requiring temperature of 75-85 degrees f and 60-80 % humidity for their health
and comfort. the facility standard operating procedure is to record the temperature and humidity weekly to ensure it is
kept in the appropriate range. the last time the facility recorded the temperature and humidity was 18 april 2023, and the
parameters were not within the range. ensuring that the temperature and humidity in a sloth enclosure is corrected if out
of range, and brought back into range is important to the welfare of the sloths.

transported in a crate in the transporter’s minivan. the dog was delivered to the receiver in jesup, iowa at approximately
midmorning on 05january2023. the dog was found cold, stiff, and clearly deceased when the transporter and receiver
opened the crate together in the transporter’s van at the receiver’s site. the transporter was unaware that the dog had
died while in his possession. this information was verified by the transporter and the iowa receiver. additional detailed
information is documented in the field service report generated by the captain of the delaware health and social
services animal welfare division, dated 06april2023.
during a two-hour phone conversation held with the transporter, the animal care transportation specialist, and the
inspector on 07june2023 at 1 pm et, the transporter stated that he had no knowledge or records of the frequency of or
the times when he checked on the dog, provided it with appropriate husbandry, food and water, or when he last saw the
dog alive.
upon discovery of the deceased dog, the receiver immediately took the body to their veterinarian, who conducted a
necropsy soon after. the veterinarian stated in the necropsy report dated 05january2023 that “the patient was emaciated
and covered with dirt and urine. after further examination, patient is severely dehydrated, eye are sucken in (sic), and has
dark tar-like stools. can confirm that patient was not fed or watered, due to severity of malnourishment.” the veterinarian
stated by phone conversation with the inspector on 15june2023 that ""there was no ingesta in the stomach or small colon
and only the dark tarry material in the large colon and the dog had been dead for at least 12 hours prior to the necropsy,
based on the level of post-mortem changes.""
by not providing routine husbandry and health observations, and not providing food and water, the transporter did not
ensure the dog’s continued good health, which resulted in serious compromise of its health and led to the starvation and
dehydration death of this dog.
the regulations state that handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that

the dog has last been offered food and water when he accepted the dog for transport. the transporter stated that he
accepted the transport even though the required documents accompanying any transport were not provided by the
consignor.
by not obtaining the required documentation of when the dog had last been fed or watered, the transporter had no idea
when the dog had last received nourishment. not having and utilizing this information resulted in the transporter having no
knowledge of when opie should have been fed again (at least once every 24 hours per 3.17(a)) and watered again (every
12 hours per 3.17(a)) during the transport. the lack of knowledge of opie’s prior nourishment status contributed to the
