I identified\\nmyself as a USDA Animal Care Inspector to the driver of the vehicle and said that I was there to conduct an\\ninspection. The driver, Sara, who was wearing a T-shirt that said \"LoneWolf\" told me that I was not allowed to\\ninspect the vehicle because she was not an authorized person.\\nOn July 02, 2019, I phoned Allison Hedgpeth, the owner of LoneWolf Pets, and explained what had happened the\\nprevious day. Ms. Hedgpeth told me that she has directed all of her employees to deny USDA access to her\\nvehicles unless she is present for the inspection. She said to go ahead and write an NCI for refusal of inspection,\\nthat she would appeal the report, and deal with the consequences.\\nAccess to vehicles, animals, and records is necessary to complete an inspection to ensure the health, comfort, and\\nsafety of the animals being transported. The registrant must allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business; to\\ninspect facilities, property, and animals; to examine and copy records; and to document non-compliant items via\\nphotographs and other means.\\nThe exit interview was conducted via phone with the registrant by Jami Niemann-SACS on July 09, 2019.',\n",
       " 'Several primates continue to exhibit several types of stereotypical behaviors, which were observed multiple times\\nfor extended periods of time during this 5 hour inspection. Although the male baboon had access to the larger\\ncage, he repeatedly paced in circles and figure eights on an elevated area of boards. At the afternoon feeding\\ntime, the female baboon in the smaller enclosure showed the swaying behavior she has previously exhibited\\nconsistently. Another baboon, Handsome, is now repeatedly rocking back and forth sideways, head tossing,\\nstanding up, circling in place, then resuming rocking. He is doing this both in his indoor and outdoor parts of the\\nenclosure. This behavior was repeated for over 5 minute periods several times throughout the inspection.\\nThe cage furniture in the three baboon enclosures has not been substantially changed in at least a year. During this\\ninspection, no enrichment was given in terms of foraging devices, browse, or any other stimulating items. The\\nanimals are fed twice a day and their food is placed in feeders and rapidly consumed. There is no time consuming\\nactivity to engage them.\\nThe male cynomolgus is still exhibiting abnormal behaviors. He has floating limb syndrome, where his left leg\\nslowly floats up, he sees it, and attacks it. He does not appear to be breaking skin during these attacks. He\\nexhibited frenzied self-attacking behaviors during the last inspection, but during this inspection, they seemed less\\nfrequent or severe. Due to his aggression to his cage mate last month, they are now separated. Although a visual\\nbarrier to get away from the public was built and more objects to manipulate (blankets and small loose toys) were\\nadded to his enclosure, he still has psychological issues. He needs to be further evaluated and treated by the\\nveterinarian.\\nAll of these animals are showing signs of psychological distress. Although they came to the zoo many years ago\\nwith these behaviors, they need to be recognized as requiring special attention, and more needs to be done to try\\nand alleviate these behaviors.\\nFor any primate exhibiting abnormal behaviors, an intensive program of enrichment needs to be implemented as\\ndirected by the attending veterinarian. This includes devising a program with special considerations given to\\nprimates showing abnormal behaviors and describing how their environment will be enhanced. Implementing the\\nprogram needs to include training employees in recognizing normal and abnormal behaviors and the importance of\\nan enrichment program. This facility needs to be able to show the enhanced program is being followed (ideally by\\ndocumentation). The program should include ongoing evaluations of the special consideration primates as to how\\nthey are responding to the enhanced enrichment program.\\nTo be corrected by 4-30-18.\\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.',\n",
