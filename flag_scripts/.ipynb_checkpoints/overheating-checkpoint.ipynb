    "## Motivation\n",
    "We noticed that a suprising number of violations mentioned \"overheating.\" Similarly, we also found a large number of violations mentioning extreme cold and hypothermia. With climates rapidly changing, these issues may become more common in the future. This flag captures violations related to extreme ambient temperatures.  "

    "## Logic Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We use several include and exclude conditions to capture relevant reports. This logic is a starting point; we will continue to iterate on improving accurate capture of violations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Include Conditions\n",
    "1. We use keywords that are temperature measurements. \n",
    "2. \"F\" is used as shorthand for Fahrenheit, but is also used in various codes mentioned in the reports. We use a Regex pattern to only capture reports mentioning \"F\" in a temperature context. \n",
    "3. We use keywords related to overheating/excessive cooling. To avoid capture of reports mentioning heating equipment (heating pads, heated blankets), the majority of keywords are results of extreme ambient temperatures: heat stress, hypothermia, heat stroke, frostbite, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exclude Conditions\n",
    "1. Many relevant reports mention temperature given in degrees. We use a Regex pattern for including recorded temperatures (80.5 degrees, 52 F, 25 Celsius) but excluding non-temperature related mentions (degrees of rust, degrees of hair loss).\n",
    "2. We exclude mentions of \"180 degrees\" which is the water temperature required for proper sanitization and an extremely improbable ambient temperature on Earth. \n"
