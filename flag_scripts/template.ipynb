Due to the heavy flooding,\\nthere were no places available for the animals to remain dry.\\nDuring the scheduled RL inspection process there was still a water line around the zebra barn, evidence of the recent\\nflooding, and the 2-month-old zebra filly had wet, dirty fur along her legs, belly and back.\\nThe Jacob sheep shelter has a section of the back wall that is caved into the shelter from recent storms causing soil and\\nrock to push into the shelter. The salt and mineral block in this area was visibly soaked from high water levels, which left\\nthe supplements contaminated by the waste of other animal enclosures from water flowing down hill into the sheep\\nenclosure.\\nThe area where the facility is located is expected to have thunderstorms and rain for the next several days with the\\ntemperatures falling into 40’s at night, according to weather reports. There is an extreme likelihood for the animals to get\\nwet from these flooded shelters and be in cold temperatures.
