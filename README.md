# aphis-inspection-reports-heatflag
Code for creating a heat/temperature flag for inspections data from USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

## Overview
* Under construction
  
## Future Directions
* The APHIS inspection report data is continually updated. The key words used in the heat/temperature flag should be reviewed and refined periodically, in case of data shift.
* Topic clustering revealed additional categories that could be added to the dataset as flags.
    * Transport of animals
    * Absent/incorrectly written programs of veterinary care
    * Flaws in animal enclosures/physical environment
    * Inspection failure due to unavailable "responsible adult"
    * Accumulation of filth in enclosure, general lack of sanitation
    * Unauthorized sale or exhibition of animals
    * Expired medications
    * Incomplete inventory of animals
