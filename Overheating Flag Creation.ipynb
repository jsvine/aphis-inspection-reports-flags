When asked the licensee stated that this was “old”, approximately 10 years old, and\\nthat some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot. He agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that\\nor his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection. Poor body condition can indicate a\\nlack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Particularly when combined\\nwith increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the\\nattending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be\\nprescribed. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can\\nlead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death.\\n- One adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the\\nmajority of its body. There were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the\\nanimal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds. The hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck\\narea. The licensee stated that he hadn’t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to\\nfleas. He agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal.\\n- One Skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown\\ntoenails. The nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal\\npositions. This skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk. When observed trying to groom its face, the\\nanimal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable. Excessively long nails can cause\\nabnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals.

In addition to this skunk,\\nat least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their\\nhealth and comfort.\\n- One adult skunk present in enclosure R2C1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface\\nof the right eye. Additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye. The licensee stated\\nthat he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract. There was no discharge,\\nhowever, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts). Ocular\\nconditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious,\\ntraumatic, or inherited.\\n- Five of the Six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present.

Body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount\\nof fiber present. The licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall. Excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to\\ndiscomfort and overheating in the hot summer months. Additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to\\nkeep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.\\n- One brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip. This\\nanimal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca’s weight / body condition.

       " \"Numerous animals were identified during the inspection as needing to be evaluated and examined by the attending\\nveterinarian (AV).\\n**DIRECT--A male tiger named Rajah had been noted to have a quarter-sized mass on the left side of the tail during\\nthe inspection conducted on 28 May 2014 which was to be examined by a veterinarian by 4 June 2014. The AV did\\na visual evaluation on 3 June 2014 and determined that anesthesia would be required to fully examine this lesion\\nand that it would need to be done when the temperatures were not too warm to avoid overheating of the animal\\nduring the procedure. No examination by the AV had been performed at the time of this inspection (7 months since\\nfirst noted) and the mass is now significantly larger with a reddened center. Masses and growing lesions may be\\ndue to infection, cancer, or other serious veterinary conditions. This animal needs to be examined by the AV as\\nsoon as possible with appropriate diagnostic testing to determine if the mass needs to be surgically removed or if\\nother treatment is needed to prevent the condition from worsening. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic\\ntesting performed, treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be made and be\\navailable for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--A male white tiger named O-jaus housed with 2 female white tigers, Samundra and Subadra, was noted\\nduring this inspection to be in thin body condition and had a very unusual posture and gait. His backbone area\\nappeared hunched with the vertebral processes appearing more prominent. His hind feet appear pigeon-toed as he\\nwalks, that he is carefully placing the hind feet, and his hips sway noticeably. The care takers present during this\\npart of the inspection were not aware if this was a recent development and no documentation of weight loss or\\nabnormal gait had been made at the time of this inspection by the animal care staff or by the AV. Weight loss and\\nabnormal gait are indicators of an underlying veterinary condition (nutritional, arthritis, injury, etc) and this animal\\nneeds to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and\\nplans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n**DIRECT--A juvenile male red kangaroo, Rascal, was noted to have numerous circular lesions on his tail by one of\\nthe care staff accompanying the inspection. Upon close examination, there were at least a dozen areas varying\\nfrom pea to quarter- size where the skin was reddened and the hair was missing in a circular pattern. The AV had\\nnot been notified of this condition which may be ringworm, a fungal infection contagious to animals and people\\n(zoonosis), or some other skin or hair condition. Documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including\\nany diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs\\nto be made and available for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--The male leopard, Bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on\\nhis tail. One of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail\\nsometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. The current areas had not been documented by care staff\\nnor reported to the AV for evaluation. This animal needs to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible\\ndiagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n- Two adult male leopards, Bagheera and Jabaree, were noted to have unusual pigmentation of their left eyes.\\nBagheera had a block of brown-copper color on the pigmented portion of the eye and Jabaree(cid:25)'s entire left eye\\nappeared to be reddish-brown in color. The licensee stated that the leopards(cid:25) have had this condition since they\\nwere cubs but the APHIS inspectors have never been able to observe these animals during inspection as they\\nalways hide in their enclosures or den boxes when the licensee is accompanying the inspection. The licensee was\\nnot present during this portion of the inspection and the leopards both came up to the enclosure fencing and\\nallowed a thorough examination. This is not a normal presentation for the eyes of leopards and there is no\\ndocumentation or information indicating what is causing the condition, how long it has been present, or whether\\nthere is any need for monitoring and treatment of the eye condition by the AV. Changes in the coloration of the eye\\nmay be a genetic condition or could indicate an underlying problem such as infection and needs to be evaluated by\\nthe AV.\\n- A male serval named Limpopo was pacing the front of his enclosure during this inspection and was noted to have\\nseveral rough areas in his hair coat on his back. This may be matted hair which can be due to lack of grooming or\\nunderlying injury or infection and should be evaluated by the AV.\\n- Three ring tailed lemurs, Bongo, Talisa, and Taz, were noted to have significant thinning and hair loss on their tails\\nthat had not been documented by the care staff nor evaluated by the AV. Thinning hair and loss of hair may be a\\nsign of overgrooming by conspecifics or by the individual animal due to stress or dominance issues, underlying\\nveterinary condition (endocrine, infection, allergies), or due to trauma to the hair follicles and needs to be evaluated\\nby the AV. Documentation of examination of these animals(cid:25)' tails, including any diagnostic testing, monitoring and\\ntreatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition needs to be made and available for review by\\nAPHIS inspectors.\\n--A ring tailed lemur named Abu was noted to be obese and had prominent raised areas on both hip areas. The\\ncare staff accompanying this portion of the inspection had not noted this condition and no documentation of this was\\navailable for APHIS at the time of the inspection. The licensee stated during the exit briefing that these were saddle\\nbags(cid:29) but the AV had not examined this animal to determine what was causing the raised areas or lumps on Abu'(cid:25)s\\nhips which may be excess fat or may be a due to a veterinary condition .\\n- A hedgehog named Cow was noted to be awake and actively running around his enclosure in the Welcome Center\\nduring daylight hours (nocturnal animal typically). Both of his eyes appeared to have white centers which may\\nindicate cataracts or another veterinary condition that may affect his vision. This condition had not been noted by\\nany of the care staff nor had the AV been notified at the time of this inspection.\\n- The carnivores (tigers, lions, bears, caracal, serval, savannah cat, leopards, bobcat, cougar) are not being fed a\\ncommercially prepared diet that is nutritionally complete. No diet plan is documented nor approved by the AV for\\nthese animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological\\nneeds. Numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body\\ncondition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than\\nadults to meet their growth needs. One of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was\\nquestioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of\\nthe vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.\\nFor example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the\\ncare staff. The recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a\\nmeat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to\\nmeet these animals daily requirement of calcium. Additionally, the licensee hand-raises tiger cubs and does not\\nhave a documented diet plan to ensure these cubs receive the appropriate nutrition to ensure their healthy growth to\\nadulthood.\\nAnimals that are not being fed a commercially prepared, nutritionally complete diet appropriate for the species and\\nto ensure their health and well-being need to have a diet plan documented and approved by the AV that is\\nmaintained, followed, updated as necessary for new animals or changes in their age or physiologic needs, and able\\nto be reviewed by APHIS inspectors.\\nThe facility must have an established program of veterinary care which ensures problems are identified and\\ncommunicated to the AV and that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat veterinary conditions\\nare used.\\nThe following animals need to examined by the AV by 14 Jan 2015:\\nTiger Rajah, Tiger Ojaus, Kangaroo Rascal, Leopard Bagheera\\nAll other animals and the nutrition plan for any animals not receiving a commercially prepared diet for their species\\nand physiologic needs must be evaluated by the AV by 2 Feb 2015.\",\n",

Both animals were enrolled in an approved IACUC protocol, and the practice of\\ntransporting two animals to imaging followed the facility procedures that had been in place for an extended period of time.\\nUpon arrival at the facility, the staff left the heater on, as the external temperature was approximately 61 degrees F and\\ntook one monkey inside, while a geriatric female rhesus macaque was left in the van. During the anesthetized procedure,\\nthe first monkey had complications and the staff left the van unattended for longer than usual. The animal in the van was\\nchecked multiple times and on the second check, was found unresponsive and appropriate veterinary care was\\nimmediately initiated. Despite immediate cooling and resuscitative procedures, the temperature initially was consistent\\nwith hyperthermia and was stabilized to below normal within 90 minutes, but the animal never regained consciousness\\nand was humanely euthanized. The heater in the van is not thermostatically controlled and the temperature rose over the\\ncourse of the extended study in the first animal, resulting in hyperthermia in the monkey remaining in the van. The\\nnecropsy indicated significant comorbidities in the animal, but confirmed that the cause of death was likely heat related.\\nThe facility temporarily stopped transporting animals offsite and immediately stopped the practice of transporting two\\nanimals at a time. The particular van was taken out of use in order to measure the temperatures in similar conditions and\\nheat was documented rapidly developing within the van, which likely exposed the animal to temperatures in excess of the\\nregulatory standard of 85 degrees F for greater than 45 minutes.

       " 'On the night of 12/6/21, the low temperature in Como, Mississippi was 30 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n**Overnight, two male giraffes were shut in a heated giraffe shelter with the heater operating. The shelter is approximately\\n24 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a dirt floor with heavy bedding, and one large door. According to facility staff, the\\ngiraffe shelter usually has 2 wall-mounted propane heaters but one was out for repairs, so there was only 1 heater which\\nwas the only source of heat for the shelter. Facility staff did not have a method of monitoring the temperature overnight.\\nFacility staff had let the giraffes out of their shelter prior to 10AM. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe\\nshed was 42 degrees Fahrenheit, and the two male giraffes were walking around on the pasture in the safari park. The\\ntwo giraffes and numerous other safari park animals had access to the heated shelter, and according to facility staff the\\nshelter’s doors were left open all day. Inside the heated shelter, with the doors open and the single heater running, the\\nambient temperature was 53 degrees Fahrenheit measured inside the barn, 5 feet off the ground, approximately 12 feet\\nfrom the front of the heater which was on (this is the location where the facility employee usually measures the\\ntemperature using an IR gun pointed at the floor). The giraffes did not use the heated shelter while inspectors were\\npresent but a camel did enter the structure. Facility staff stated that while other animals including buffalo use the heated\\nshelter throughout the day, it does not appear to prevent the giraffes from using the shelter and multiple species have\\nbeen observed in the shelter together.\\n**Overnight, one adult female giraffe and one 7-month-old female giraffe calf were housed in a 60 foot by 80 foot heated\\ngiraffe barn with 1 parrot and 3 caracal cats. The giraffe barn contains 3 stalls, each with their own narrow roll-up door to\\nthe outside. The giraffes were located in the middle stall. The roll up giraffe doors are located on the north side of the\\nbarn, and within the barn the giraffe stalls take up the north half of the barn. The heaters are mounted on the south wall of\\nthe barn. Facility staff reported that the calf had been nervous to enter the barn in the past but had begun entering the\\nbarn more often recently; staff also reported that the calf appeared to be nervous when the barn doors were shut with her\\ninside, so the roll-up door to the central stall was left about 2/3 raised (open) all night. An enclosure housing 3 caracal\\ncats is located approximately 6 feet in front of the central giraffe stall with no visual barriers between the giraffes and the\\ncats.\\nThe female giraffes had access to the outdoors and to central stall overnight and throughout the day. The other doors to\\nthe barn were kept closed and the wall-mounted propane heaters were left running all night (the only heat source in the\\nbarn). Facility staff did not have any means of measuring the temperature in the barn overnight, and they had not yet\\ntaken the temperature in the barn that morning. At 10AM the ambient temperature outside the giraffe barn was 42\\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The female giraffes were observed to be inside the center stall in the giraffe barn with their heads\\nintermittently poking out of the roll-up door to look outside. The calf stood next to the open roll-up door for the duration of\\nthe inspection (approximately 15 minutes, observed first from a distance and then from within the barn). The temperature\\nwithin the barn, measured at a height of approximately 5 feet, at the center of the barn immediately in front of the stall\\nhousing the giraffes, was 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature was likely cooler next to the open roll-up door where\\nthe calf was standing due to the draft from the door, but it could not be measured without stressing the animal.\\nGiraffes are very sensitive to cold temperatures. Giraffes who do not have adequate shelter from cold weather may suffer\\nfrom discomfort, frostbite, hypothermia, and decreased ability to fight off infections.
