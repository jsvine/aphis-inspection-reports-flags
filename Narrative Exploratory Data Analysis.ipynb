    "### Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "- At 419 narratives, the heat/temperature flag has just 2% coverage of total narratives\n",
    "    - TFIDF values for heat and temperature are also low, not in top ~300 terms <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mention of “heat” does not always mean the inspection revealed the animal was subject to overheating/excessive cooling.\n",
    "    - Why? “Overheating” or \"heat\" is often a sub-item in a standardized list of ways an animal should not be treated. The sentiment roughly reads (the exact phrasing changes; possibly a sentence included in some guiding inspection document): “all handling of animals should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause **overheating**, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.”\n",
    "        - 144 narratives contain the substring “carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause” (likely an undercount of the sub-item phenomenon)\n",
    "    - Additionally, heat/temperature can also be used to describe an outcome to prevent, for example: \"... repair the electrical outlet and then determine the capability of the unit to insure in can store food at the proper **temperature** and humidity.\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering narratives according to mention of heat/temperature still results in diverse inspection findings/recommendations\n",
    "     - Animals suffered from overheating \n",
    "         - E.g. \"The initial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature\\nfor hamsters, leading to an ambient temperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hour\" \n",
    "        - \"On May 2, 2022, four Damaraland mole rats were found dead in their enclosures. According to facility personnel, an\\nelectric space heater that was being used to provide supplemental heat for the animals was somehow placed under the\\nmetal rack holding the enclosures resulting in the animals overheating.\"\n",
    "    - Improper sanitization procedures\n",
    "        - \"The facility could not verify that the Guinea Pig primary enclosures are being adequately sanitized. The facility currently\\nuses temperature-tapes to verify that the correct temperature (180 degrees Fahrenheit) is reached by the automated\\nwashing systems. There have been numerous failures of this system to reach the required temperatures and numerous\\nadditional weeks where the staff has failed to follow their internal procedures to test the temperatures in order to verify\\nthat the washing system is functioning properly.\\nTemperature tape readings record whether the cage wash reaches the required 180 degrees.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "- What is the purpose behind identifying narratives involving heat/temperature?\n",
    "    - A frequently occuring inspection theme is flaws in animals' enclosures. Inadequate enclosures can lead to animal overheating/underheating. Should the flag focus on the outcome (overheating/underheating) or the initial failure in enclosure maintenance/construction?\n",
    "- What are more useful flags for assisting future analysis of this dataset? \n",
    "- Should flags aim for broadness/coverage? Or should flags identify very specific/rare phenomenons?"

       " 'On 19 August 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per\\nenclosure). Upon arrival, 32 rabbits were noted to be dead; several others were observed by the receiving\\nindividuals to be in some degree of respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were\\nobserved in an undetermined number of animals). The next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also\\nsuspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. An investigation of the\\ncircumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size\\nthan the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow\\nbetween cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. The driver noted the discrepancy in the\\ndimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals\\nwere loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. The driver stopped to observe the\\nanimals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon\\narrival at their final destination.\\nInadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to\\nbreathe normally. Additionally, reduced airflow can cause the ambient temperatures inside the enclosures to\\nbecome too high, even if the temperatures inside the cargo area as a whole are within range (this was the case with\\nthis shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout\\ntransit). Deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the\\nload (33 of 380 animals).\\nThe primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air\\nfor normal breathing. The intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,\\nincluding re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles\\nused to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint\\nlines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation.

As a goat not intended for the project, the animal did not receive the\\ninitial physical exam, bloodwork, and additional testing to ensure that it met the specified health standards written in\\nthe protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The animal also was not given the opportunity to go\\nthrough the facility’s typical acclimation phase in which smaller volumes of blood are drawn over time before\\ncollecting the maximum blood volume. Before the bleeding occurred, the animal did not exhibit any signs of illness.\\nThat afternoon, the animal was found to have profuse diarrhea and was treated as directed by the attending\\nveterinarian. Later that evening, the animal was observed in distress by a staff member and was humanely\\neuthanized.\\nThe facility has well documented protocols and SOPs regarding blood collection procedures. The individual\\nconducting the procedure was trained and found to be proficient to perform this task by the facility prior to this event\\noccurring. The internal IACUC investigation following this incident concluded that it occurred due to human error\\n(failing to check the animal’s identification correctly as required by the SOP).\\nThe research protocol and SOP included several appropriate methods to ensure that handling of animals used\\nunder the protocol are handled in a careful manner that minimizes stress and physical harm (including pre-use\\nphysical examination, bloodwork, and fecal examination). As a result of the human error in checking identification,\\nnone of these methods were used for this animal. Large volume blood collections without adequate pre-collection\\ntesting may result in the worsening of underlying illness not obvious at the time of collection making subsequent\\ntreatment more difficult. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a\\nmanner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The unintentional bleeding of the\\ndonor goat, resulted in unnecessary physical harm and likely contributed to the death of the animal.\\nThe facility took immediate corrective actions to address the incident. Management investigated the issue,\\nsubmitted the finding to the IACUC for review, and quickly retrained all of the large animal technicians on the\\nprotocol and SOP procedures.\\nCorrect from this day forward by ensuring corrective actions are followed to prevent further occurrence of incidents.\\nThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.\\nAdditional Inspectors\\nRadzai Christina, Veterinary Medical Officer',\n",

       " \"***On May 10, 2015 the facility noted that a young male juvenile lion, Thor, was displaying inappropriate mentation\\nand had limited mobility. According to the facility, the Attending Veterinarian was consulted regarding the condition\\nof the juvenile and examined the animal on May 10, 2015 and June 19, 2015. The veterinarian assessed the animal\\nvisually and produced a differential diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome. As of July 14, 2015 the veterinarian\\nscheduled for additional diagnostics to include blood-work and a MRI. The facility management was unable to\\nproduce records regarding the veterinary treatment plan for this animal. The records that were able to be produced\\nindicated the date of the initial visual assessment by the veterinarian, the differential diagnosis of Dandy Walker\\nsyndrome, and a plan for future diagnostics. Between the time when the facility first noted issues with the animal\\nand the date of the inspection, the veterinarian had not taken any diagnostic samples from the animal to support a\\ndiagnosis. Limited records were able to be produced regarding the care of the animals at Living Treasures Animal\\nPark. During the inspection on July 14, 2015 the juvenile lion was housed in the back holding area of the enclosure\\nand remained in a resting position refusing to rise after being prompted with food. The facility offered a video\\nrecording as a representation of the juvenile(cid:25)s movement. In this recording the animal appeared to be stiff on all four\\nlimbs and reluctant to move, even for short distances. On July 15, 2015 the juvenile was in the main enclosure with\\nhis mother, the animal remained in a laying position and there were no apparent signs of injury during our\\nobservation. The facility representatives indicated that the juvenile was still very stiff in his movements, but had\\nshowed interest in playing with his mother immediately after his release into the main enclosure. He had a\\nroughened hair coat that had a moderate amount of mud along his back and on all four legs consistent with the\\nanimal(cid:25)'s movement around or through the mud within the enclosure. The documented diet for this animal includes\\n7lbs. of mixed red meat and poultry and to be supplemented with Platinum Performance: Exotic Wellness and\\nPerformance Formula. During conversation with the facility management, they stated this animal refuses to eat the\\nbones within the meat fed. This current feeding program provides very little calcium and other nutrients for the\\ngrowing animal. Upon inspection of the supplement there was a white film on the surface and the supplement was\\nheavily caked providing clear evidence that the supplement was not being consistently used. After speaking with the\\nveterinarian regarding the care of this animal, her initial assessment of the inappropriate mentation was made on\\nMay 4, 2015. In the record for that date she suspected neurologic disease, she recommended deworming and\\nantihistamine therapy. She completed a second visual assessment on June 19, 2015, when she noted weight loss\\nand recommended tranquilization for a hands on physical exam and further diagnostics. On the second visual\\nassessment, the veterinarian'(cid:25)s differential diagnoses were Dandy-Walker syndrome, vestibular disease or\\nincomplete fusion of cervical vertebra. According to the attending veterinarian, a dietary cause was not explored\\nbecause the adults were receiving the same diet and showed no signs of illness. The failure to understand that\\nyoung, growing large carnivores may have additional nutritional needs show a clear lack of adequate training and\\nveterinary care. Metabolic Bone Disease is a common disease of young big cats. This disease stems from\\ninadequate levels of calcium in the diet. During early development the animal will need an increased level of\\ncalcium in the diet to allow for bone growth. At the time of the inspection there was no evidence that the diet has the\\nproper nutritive values to maintain the animal in good health. The deficiency of adequate nutrition may have caused\\nthis animal severe animal welfare concerns. The length in time to get diagnostic information about the lion(cid:25)'s\\ncondition and the lack of attention to investigate the nutritional value of the lion(cid:25)'s diet illustrate that appropriate\\nmethods were not taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. Correct by, (1) providing a fully nutritious and\\nwholesome diet, (2) having an experienced and knowledgeable veterinarian examine, diagnostic, and treat the lion,\\n(3) have a written treatment plan available for inspection. Correct by 6 p.m.7/17/15. At the time of exit interview, the\\nfacility has started putting calcium supplements in the food, but has not developed a treatment program for the\\nanimal. Thor was transported to another U.S.D.A licensed facility on 7/17/15.\\n***A female Timber Wolf was observed to have irritated areas on the external margins of both of her ears.\\nApproximately one inch along the edges and back of the ears is both thickened, crusted over and had several spots\\nwhere blood is apparent. The affected areas are missing hair and the underlying skin is black to grey in color. These\\nchanges are commonly associated with chronic injury to the skin. The problem was exacerbated by the flies which\\nwere noted to be on the affected areas causing the wolf to shake her head and rub her ears on the rocks and\\nvegetation within the enclosure. The facility representative indicated that the areas were being treated using\\nfly-spray to decrease irritation and prevent future rubbing and scratching of the area. However; during the\\ninspection, the facility was not able to produce any documentation to support a proper diagnosis or treatment has\\nbeen made by the attending veterinarian. After discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that\\napproximately one month prior to inspection the facility had been consulted to treat the Timber Wolves for a heavy\\nmite infestation. This infestation had become recurrent in warmer weathers and the veterinarian had documented\\nthe need for multiple treatments.

The facility indicated that the animal had been treated by a veterinarian and\\ndiagnosed with an elbow injury. The animal was put into a cast and prescribed pain management at the time of\\ninjury. After the cast was removed no further pain management was provided. A veterinarian has not been\\nconsulted for further assessment or treatment of this animal'(cid:25)s condition and no documentation was provided to\\nsupport any form of diagnosis or treatment. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian, it was determined that\\nthe animal was under the care and custody of the veterinarian at the time of the arm injury. The animal was being\\ntreated at the veterinary clinic for heavy fenbendazole resistant parasite infestation. During restraint of the animal for\\ntreatment, the arm was fractured. During the Attending Veterinarian visit on July 15, 2015 further deworming of the\\nanimal and suggested enrichment based physical therapy to increase the functionality of the arm.

This abnormality could be\\nsecondary to an underlying condition with the eye or secondary age related change. After the Attending\\nVeterinarian examined the animal it was determined that the injury was an old corneal scar. She determined no\\ntreatment was needed at this time and the prognosis of the animal was good. Correct by documenting the\\nveterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation of the abnormality. Correct by 7/17/15.\\n***An adult male Aoudad was noted to have a subcutaneous mass over his left shoulder. The mass did not appear\\nto cause the animal immediate discomfort and did not appear to be impacting or limiting his mobility. When asked,\\nthe facility representative indicated that the mass was caused by an old injury that had been previously discussed\\nwith the veterinarian. Records were not provided for the facility documenting that the issue had been addressed by\\nthe veterinarian. After discussion with the Attending Veterinarian the injury was confirmed. The veterinarian\\nindicated that the injury had abscessed and had ruptured prior to her observation. The injury may have\\nre-abscessed, leading to the mass appearance on the animal'(cid:25)s side. After a second examination by the Attending\\nVeterinarian on July 15, 2015 it was determined that the wound had re-abscessed and encapsulated. The mass\\nwould have to be removed to properly heal the injury. The mass on the adult Aoudad could be a sign of secondary\\ninfection or other disease which could lead to pain or distress for the animal.

Euthanasia is defined by the Animal\\nWelfare Act as “the humane destruction of an animal accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness\\nand subsequent death without the evidence of pain or distress, or a method that utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent\\nthat causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death”.\\nThe Program of Veterinary Care states euthanasia can be carried out by the veterinarian or the licensee by gunshot or\\nlethal injection but does not provide any further guidance.

When reading through animal records, the inspector found a note under the bald eagle’s\\nrecord stating that “two rabbits were shot and fed to the bald eagle because only 2 rabbits were wanted for the winter.”\\nWhen the inspector interviewed the facility representative that performed this euthanasia, the gunshot (.22 caliber rifle) to\\nthe head did render the rabbits unconscious immediately.

This took place because the eagle was evaluated by a veterinarian and the facility was\\ninstructed to provide more calories and calcium to the eagle.
