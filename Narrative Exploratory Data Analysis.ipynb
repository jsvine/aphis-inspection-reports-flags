The condition was detected and treated appropriately by the veterinary staff, and the pig was humanely\\neuthanized in a timely fashion. Upon further investigation, the IACUC concluded that the surgeon performing the\\nprocedure was unfamiliar with male pig anatomy, as only females had been used previously, and that improper\\ntraining to conduct this procedure on a male pig was a contributing factor to this adverse event. The IACUC then\\nrequired the PI to ensure that training was sufficient to eliminate the possibility of another such adverse event, and\\nthe PI voluntarily indicated that the surgeons involved in these experiments would no longer use male pigs.\\nBecause an animal was prematurely euthanized due to an error in surgical training that was rectified subsequently\\nby the IACUC, this constitutes a serious animal welfare incident.\\nPersonnel must be adequately trained on conducting the procedures, taking into consideration species, anatomy,\\netc.; it is the job of the IACUC to ensure that this training is adequate to prevent adverse surgical errors and avoid\\nserious animal welfare impacts.\\nThis incident had been fully investigated and corrected by the IACUC at the time of inspection.\\nThe routine inspection, records review, and exit briefing was conducted with various responsible University of\\nMichigan staff.\\nAdditional Inspectors\\nCampitelli D.V.M Kathryn, Veterinary Medical Officer\",\n",

The changes made include: 1)\\nswitching from an injectable sedative to a strictly inhalant anesthetic for imaging and blood sampling; 2) changing the\\nvascular access location for obtaining blood; 3) removing intubation in favor of masking during longer procedures or\\naltogether for very short procedures such as imaging; and 4) discontinuing the use of an injectable medication in favor of\\nan oral drug. According to the PI, vet tech and animal medical records, the modified protocol was implemented soon after\\nthe discussion. However, the current approved protocol on record with the IACUC and reviewed during this inspection\\ndoes not reflect these changes.\\nMaking changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate\\noversight into the use of animals for medical research.\\nCorrect by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed\\nsignificant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.

The crates are 12 inches tall, which is 2 inches short of the AWA requirements.\\nThe floor space provided by the crates is 20 inches long x 11 inches wide / 144 = 1.52 square feet; this is adequate for\\nrabbits under 2 kilograms (who require 1.5 square feet of space) but is not adequate for rabbits weighing 2-4 kilograms\\n(who require 3.0 square feet). Some of the rabbits used in the study weight less than 2 kilograms, but others weigh\\nbetween 2 and 4 kilograms. According to facility staff, the animals live in the crates at the satellite location for about 24\\nhours, and there is no other housing used for the rabbits at the satellite location.

This is a repeat critical\\nnon-compliance.\\nThe method of euthanasia for guinea pigs in the facility utilizes tanked carbon dioxide gas delivered to a euthanasia\\nchamber. The chamber is a galvanized tub covered with a clear acrylic plastic lid. A pressure reducing regulator is\\nconnected to the gas tank and is used to control gas pressure from the tank to the gas supply line going to the tub\\nenclosure. No flow meter or other monitoring device is present in the system to monitor gas flow rates into the\\nchamber. A facility manager stated the outflow pressure of gas from the tank is set at 30 psi at the regulator.

The procedure in use by\\nthe facility lacks a flow meter to accurately maintain and monitor consistent gas flow rates to the chamber during the\\neuthanasia process. The use of a tank regulator pre-set at a specific psi is not sufficient of itself to ensure that an\\naccurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being consistently delivered to the euthanasia chamber and\\nrecommended gas displacement rates are being achieved. Without an appropriate sized flow meter in place,\\nchamber gas displacement rates may be too high or too low. This may then lead to significant pain and distress to\\nguinea pigs during the euthanasia process.\\nAVMA guidelines for carbon dioxide gas usage recommend a chamber displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber\\nvolume/minute. This displacement rate has been found to produce less pain and distress during the onset of\\nunconsciousness than other rates.\\nOverall, methods of euthanasia used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with\\n9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.\\nA flow meter and appropriate methodology shall be employed to ensure that accurate carbon dioxide gas flow rates\\nand chamber displacement rates are consistently maintained and monitored by facility personnel during the\\neuthanasia process.

    "### Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "- At 419 narratives, the heat/temperature flag has just 2% coverage of total narratives\n",
    "    - TFIDF values for heat and temperature are also low, not in top ~300 terms <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mention of “heat” does not always mean the inspection revealed the animal was subject to overheating/excessive cooling.\n",
    "    - Why? “Overheating” or \"heat\" is often a sub-item in a standardized list of ways an animal should not be treated. The sentiment roughly reads (the exact phrasing changes; possibly a sentence included in some guiding inspection document): “all handling of animals should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause **overheating**, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.”\n",
    "        - 144 narratives contain the substring “carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause” (likely an undercount of the sub-item phenomenon)\n",
    "    - Additionally, heat/temperature can also be used to describe an outcome to prevent, for example: \"... repair the electrical outlet and then determine the capability of the unit to insure in can store food at the proper **temperature** and humidity.\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering narratives according to mention of heat/temperature still results in diverse inspection findings/recommendations\n",
    "     - Animals suffered from overheating \n",
    "         - E.g. \"The initial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature\\nfor hamsters, leading to an ambient temperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hour\" \n",
    "        - \"On May 2, 2022, four Damaraland mole rats were found dead in their enclosures. According to facility personnel, an\\nelectric space heater that was being used to provide supplemental heat for the animals was somehow placed under the\\nmetal rack holding the enclosures resulting in the animals overheating.\"\n",
    "    - Improper sanitization procedures\n",
    "        - \"The facility could not verify that the Guinea Pig primary enclosures are being adequately sanitized. The facility currently\\nuses temperature-tapes to verify that the correct temperature (180 degrees Fahrenheit) is reached by the automated\\nwashing systems. There have been numerous failures of this system to reach the required temperatures and numerous\\nadditional weeks where the staff has failed to follow their internal procedures to test the temperatures in order to verify\\nthat the washing system is functioning properly.\\nTemperature tape readings record whether the cage wash reaches the required 180 degrees.\"\n",

    "### Questions\n",
    "- What is the purpose behind identifying narratives involving heat/temperature?\n",
    "    - A frequently occuring inspection theme is flaws in animals' enclosures. Inadequate enclosures can lead to animal overheating/underheating. Should the flag focus on the outcome (overheating/underheating) or the initial failure in enclosure maintenance/construction?\n",
    "- What are more useful flags for assisting future analysis of this dataset? \n",
    "- Should flags aim for broadness/coverage? Or should flags identify very specific/rare phenomenons?"

There have been numerous failures of this system to reach the required temperatures and numerous\\nadditional weeks where the staff has failed to follow their internal procedures to test the temperatures in order to verify\\nthat the washing system is functioning properly.\\nTemperature tape readings record whether the cage wash reaches the required 180 degrees. Records were evaluated for\\na 25-week period from January to June 2023. Although the facility’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) require\\ntemperature tape to be used a minimum of weekly, during the 25-week period for which cage wash temperatures were\\nevaluated, temperature tape was only used a total of 14 weeks for the Rack washer and 16 weeks for the Tunnel washer\\n(missing a total of 11 weeks and 9 weeks respectively). Of the weeks that were tested, records showed that the color\\nchange was incomplete (indicating a failure to reach temperature) a total of 7 times for the Rack washer system and an\\nadditional 4 times for the tunnel washer system showing that the systems are failing to reach sufficient temperature a\\nsignificant portion of the time. Additionally, the same SOP requires that when there is a failure of the cage washing\\nsystem to reach the appropriate temperature that staff must conduct additional temp-tape monitoring of temperature every\\nday for 7 days. For times where the color change was incomplete, the facility only recorded a portion of them as a\\n“failure.” Following an identified “failure” to reach temperature, temperatures were monitored for at most an additional 1-2\\ndays, demonstrating a lack of adherence to the facility’s internal SOPs. When asked, the facility representative states that\\nduring failures an alternate sanitization method is implemented including the use of a disinfectant (a detergent is used in a\\nprevious step). The facility representative confirmed they have no means of determining whether the alternate sanitization\\nmethods are occurring or not after these known failures to reach required temperatures. Based on the number of times\\nthe system has failed to reach the required minimum temperature and the repeated failure of staff to follow the internal\\nSOPs regarding monitoring, there are instances where cages are not being appropriately sanitized.\\nInadequate sanitization could allow for the growth of disease-causing agents that may increase the risk of health hazards\\ntowards the animals.

The AV did\\na visual evaluation on 3 June 2014 and determined that anesthesia would be required to fully examine this lesion\\nand that it would need to be done when the temperatures were not too warm to avoid overheating of the animal\\nduring the procedure. No examination by the AV had been performed at the time of this inspection (7 months since\\nfirst noted) and the mass is now significantly larger with a reddened center. Masses and growing lesions may be\\ndue to infection, cancer, or other serious veterinary conditions. This animal needs to be examined by the AV as\\nsoon as possible with appropriate diagnostic testing to determine if the mass needs to be surgically removed or if\\nother treatment is needed to prevent the condition from worsening. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic\\ntesting performed, treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be made and be\\navailable for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--A male white tiger named O-jaus housed with 2 female white tigers, Samundra and Subadra, was noted\\nduring this inspection to be in thin body condition and had a very unusual posture and gait. His backbone area\\nappeared hunched with the vertebral processes appearing more prominent. His hind feet appear pigeon-toed as he\\nwalks, that he is carefully placing the hind feet, and his hips sway noticeably. The care takers present during this\\npart of the inspection were not aware if this was a recent development and no documentation of weight loss or\\nabnormal gait had been made at the time of this inspection by the animal care staff or by the AV. Weight loss and\\nabnormal gait are indicators of an underlying veterinary condition (nutritional, arthritis, injury, etc) and this animal\\nneeds to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and\\nplans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n**DIRECT--A juvenile male red kangaroo, Rascal, was noted to have numerous circular lesions on his tail by one of\\nthe care staff accompanying the inspection. Upon close examination, there were at least a dozen areas varying\\nfrom pea to quarter- size where the skin was reddened and the hair was missing in a circular pattern. The AV had\\nnot been notified of this condition which may be ringworm, a fungal infection contagious to animals and people\\n(zoonosis), or some other skin or hair condition. Documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including\\nany diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs\\nto be made and available for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--The male leopard, Bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on\\nhis tail. One of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail\\nsometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. The current areas had not been documented by care staff\\nnor reported to the AV for evaluation.

No diet plan is documented nor approved by the AV for\\nthese animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological\\nneeds. Numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body\\ncondition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than\\nadults to meet their growth needs. One of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was\\nquestioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of\\nthe vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.\\nFor example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the\\ncare staff. The recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a\\nmeat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to\\nmeet these animals daily requirement of calcium.

According to the National Weather\\nService, the air temperature for the area at the time of inspection (approximately 11:00am) was 40 degrees F.\\nThere was only a minimal amount of bedding material inside the shelters. Some of the shelters had most of the\\nfloor exposed while others had a thin layer of bedding that was fairly evenly distributed on the floor with parts of the\\nfloor easily seen. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient source to keep them warm increases\\nthe risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain clean, dry,\\nbedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10 [deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is\\nrequired when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower.

At that time, facility management\\nindicated that their chlorine levels were maintained at less than 1 PPM total chlorine.\\nSince June 2020, records from this water quality system show that total chlorine was often more than 1.5 PPM, and was\\nregularly above 1.8 PPM. Records show that free chlorine often regularly exceeded 0.5 PPM.\\nChlorine may contribute to the development and worsening of eye disease in captive sea lions. Chlorine and its\\nbyproducts are extremely irritating to eyes and mucus membranes, yet captive sea lions depend on pools of water in their\\nenclosure to maintain normal body temperature and to exercise normal behaviors. Ulcers, infections, and inflammation on\\nthe surface of the eye are extremely painful and may cause vision loss, and may affect an animal’s willingness or ability to\\neat, swim, ambulate, or rest comfortably. Animals with ulcerated eyes are especially vulnerable to the pain and irritation\\ncaused by exposure to chlorinated water. Sea lions are a high anesthetic risk, so eye problems that progress to a level\\nwhere anesthesia or surgery is needed are especially hazardous to the animals’ health and longevity.\\nCorrect by maintaining appropriate levels of chlorine in marine mammal enclosures or an alternative system to maintain\\nideal water quality so there is no detrimental effect to the health of the animals contained therein.

This includes:\\n* Takin male (10 years old) ID # 112003 was on exhibit Sept 5, 2022 in pasture D when staff observed he was 3-legged\\nlame. This animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending Veterinarian. Upon exam he was in\\ngood body condition but had a RF comminuted fracture of humerus. Due to extent of injuries, he was humanely\\neuthanized. Pathology reports confirmed the fracture of the distal humerus and cubital joint as well as extensive bruising\\nof the surrounding area. Medical records indicated that this Takin also had swelling of the left eye on Aug 4, 2022 which\\nwas suspected to be due to trauma (though a primary ocular cause was not able to be ruled out). Although this individual\\nwas described by the facility staff as the primary breeding male Takin for many years. Records indicate that as of August\\n2022 another male Takin was showing dominant behavior.\\n* Takin male (8 years old) ID # 114007 was on exhibit Nov 7, 2022 in pasture D when staff reported the animal appeared\\nlethargic and had lost body condition. Animal was anesthetized the same day for examination by the Attending\\nVeterinarian who found a deep puncture wound on left caudal abdomen and suspected septicemia. This Takin was\\neuthanized due to guarded prognosis and on necropsy the wound was further explored. On necropsy it was determined\\nthat this wound extended 20 cm in several directions and while it did not connect with the body cavity adhesions and scar\\ntissue indicated that it likely did previously. This same animal had an abscess of the left shoulder in November of 2020\\nthat is also consistent with prior fighting. This Takin was appropriately treated and recovered at that time.\\nCurrently the facility maintains a large herd of Takin which is composed of approximately 20 males to 25 females. This\\ngroup of animals is housed in an open pasture that is approximately 100 acres, is shared with other species, and has\\nvarying topographic features. Wild Takin originate from Asia where they inhabit rocky terrain, dense forest, and alpine\\nareas. They usually are found in large social groups with females and offspring making up 98% of the herd. Both males\\nand females have their own dominance hierarchy structure. Mature males enter a breeding period seasonally known as\\n\"rut\" in which males often fight for dominance and the ability to breed with females. Non-dominant adult males are\\ntypically not found living with breeding groups and tend to be more solitary. During rut, young mature males may\\nchallenge the dominant male fighting for access to breeding females but typically the loosing male will not remain with the\\nherd after such a challenge.\\nDuring the inspection facility staff described that they typically have one primary breeding male and a small number of\\nother males which may breed with fewer females. The facility currently maintains too many male Takin in the breeding\\nenclosure/pasture and continues to have animals injured as a result of the lack of separation. As of December 2022,\\nthere is no separate area (or bachelor group) of non-dominant male Takin. The number and concentration of mature male\\nanimals is likely leads to an increased number of challenges to the dominant breeding male(s) by other mature\\nsubordinate males that are housed within the same area. Additionally, this concentration of males also likely leads to\\nincreased sparring and conflict between subordinate males as well. Although sparring and fighting or access to breeding\\nfemales is a normal behavioral pattern in wild Takin, the traumatic injuries which lead to the deaths of these animals\\nindicate that the co-housed animals are causing injury and discomfort. Given the number of co-housed males, the\\ndominant male and his females also cannot easily move away from challengers and are left in a position to have to\\nconstantly fight challenging males during breeding season while also actively breeding females which can leave the\\ndominant male exhausted, causing discomfort and interfering with his health. Having this many intact breeding males in\\none group with the breeding females is currently interfering with the compatibility of the herd. The facility still does not\\nhave a plan in place to be able to separate the established dominant male Takin and females from subordinate males to\\nreduce these conflicts which are causing traumatic injuries to various animals.\\nFailure to ensure adequate separation of incompatible animals can result in behavioral stress, injuries, unnecessary\\nsuffering, and death. Correct by ensuring that all animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and\\nensuring through daily observation that staff intervenes to ensure adequate separation when incompatibility arises.\\nThis inspection was conducted with the Director of Animal Management and Vice President.

The AV did\\na visual evaluation on 3 June 2014 and determined that anesthesia would be required to fully examine this lesion\\nand that it would need to be done when the temperatures were not too warm to avoid overheating of the animal\\nduring the procedure. No examination by the AV had been performed at the time of this inspection (7 months since\\nfirst noted) and the mass is now significantly larger with a reddened center. Masses and growing lesions may be\\ndue to infection, cancer, or other serious veterinary conditions. This animal needs to be examined by the AV as\\nsoon as possible with appropriate diagnostic testing to determine if the mass needs to be surgically removed or if\\nother treatment is needed to prevent the condition from worsening. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic\\ntesting performed, treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be made and be\\navailable for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--A male white tiger named O-jaus housed with 2 female white tigers, Samundra and Subadra, was noted\\nduring this inspection to be in thin body condition and had a very unusual posture and gait. His backbone area\\nappeared hunched with the vertebral processes appearing more prominent. His hind feet appear pigeon-toed as he\\nwalks, that he is carefully placing the hind feet, and his hips sway noticeably. The care takers present during this\\npart of the inspection were not aware if this was a recent development and no documentation of weight loss or\\nabnormal gait had been made at the time of this inspection by the animal care staff or by the AV. Weight loss and\\nabnormal gait are indicators of an underlying veterinary condition (nutritional, arthritis, injury, etc) and this animal\\nneeds to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible diagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and\\nplans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n**DIRECT--A juvenile male red kangaroo, Rascal, was noted to have numerous circular lesions on his tail by one of\\nthe care staff accompanying the inspection. Upon close examination, there were at least a dozen areas varying\\nfrom pea to quarter- size where the skin was reddened and the hair was missing in a circular pattern. The AV had\\nnot been notified of this condition which may be ringworm, a fungal infection contagious to animals and people\\n(zoonosis), or some other skin or hair condition. Documentation of the examination of this animal(cid:25)'s tail, including\\nany diagnostic testing, monitoring and treatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition, needs\\nto be made and available for review by APHIS inspectors.\\n**DIRECT--The male leopard, Bagheera, had at least two areas of missing hair and reddened, raw looking skin on\\nhis tail. One of the care staff accompanying the inspection mentioned that he had been known to suck his tail\\nsometimes and the lesions could be from that behavior. The current areas had not been documented by care staff\\nnor reported to the AV for evaluation. This animal needs to be examined by the AV with documentation of possible\\ndiagnosis, observation and treatment plans, and plans to be re-evaluated and follow-up on his condition by the AV.\\n- Two adult male leopards, Bagheera and Jabaree, were noted to have unusual pigmentation of their left eyes.\\nBagheera had a block of brown-copper color on the pigmented portion of the eye and Jabaree(cid:25)'s entire left eye\\nappeared to be reddish-brown in color. The licensee stated that the leopards(cid:25) have had this condition since they\\nwere cubs but the APHIS inspectors have never been able to observe these animals during inspection as they\\nalways hide in their enclosures or den boxes when the licensee is accompanying the inspection. The licensee was\\nnot present during this portion of the inspection and the leopards both came up to the enclosure fencing and\\nallowed a thorough examination. This is not a normal presentation for the eyes of leopards and there is no\\ndocumentation or information indicating what is causing the condition, how long it has been present, or whether\\nthere is any need for monitoring and treatment of the eye condition by the AV. Changes in the coloration of the eye\\nmay be a genetic condition or could indicate an underlying problem such as infection and needs to be evaluated by\\nthe AV.\\n- A male serval named Limpopo was pacing the front of his enclosure during this inspection and was noted to have\\nseveral rough areas in his hair coat on his back. This may be matted hair which can be due to lack of grooming or\\nunderlying injury or infection and should be evaluated by the AV.\\n- Three ring tailed lemurs, Bongo, Talisa, and Taz, were noted to have significant thinning and hair loss on their tails\\nthat had not been documented by the care staff nor evaluated by the AV. Thinning hair and loss of hair may be a\\nsign of overgrooming by conspecifics or by the individual animal due to stress or dominance issues, underlying\\nveterinary condition (endocrine, infection, allergies), or due to trauma to the hair follicles and needs to be evaluated\\nby the AV. Documentation of examination of these animals(cid:25)' tails, including any diagnostic testing, monitoring and\\ntreatment plans, plan for re-evaluation for resolution of the condition needs to be made and available for review by\\nAPHIS inspectors.\\n--A ring tailed lemur named Abu was noted to be obese and had prominent raised areas on both hip areas. The\\ncare staff accompanying this portion of the inspection had not noted this condition and no documentation of this was\\navailable for APHIS at the time of the inspection. The licensee stated during the exit briefing that these were saddle\\nbags(cid:29) but the AV had not examined this animal to determine what was causing the raised areas or lumps on Abu'(cid:25)s\\nhips which may be excess fat or may be a due to a veterinary condition .\\n- A hedgehog named Cow was noted to be awake and actively running around his enclosure in the Welcome Center\\nduring daylight hours (nocturnal animal typically). Both of his eyes appeared to have white centers which may\\nindicate cataracts or another veterinary condition that may affect his vision. This condition had not been noted by\\nany of the care staff nor had the AV been notified at the time of this inspection.\\n- The carnivores (tigers, lions, bears, caracal, serval, savannah cat, leopards, bobcat, cougar) are not being fed a\\ncommercially prepared diet that is nutritionally complete. No diet plan is documented nor approved by the AV for\\nthese animals and there is no way to determine that they are receiving adequate nutrition to meet their physiological\\nneeds. Numerous animals were obese, especially the leopards, bobcat, and serval, while one tiger was in thin body\\ncondition and there are several young growing animals that require more vitamin and mineral supplementation than\\nadults to meet their growth needs. One of the care staff that was responsible for feeding these animals was\\nquestioned about the supplements provided for this non-commercial, meat-based diet and there is no measuring of\\nthe vitamin or mineral supplements so there is no way to be sure the animals are receiving an appropriate dose.\\nFor example, dicalcium phosphate is dusted on one piece of meat that is fed to the tigers and lions according to the\\ncare staff. The recommended dose for dicalcium phosphate as a supplement for big cats that are being fed a\\nmeat-based diet is 8.8 grams added to 1 lb of meat and just dusting one piece of meat is not likely to be adequate to\\nmeet these animals daily requirement of calcium. Additionally, the licensee hand-raises tiger cubs and does not\\nhave a documented diet plan to ensure these cubs receive the appropriate nutrition to ensure their healthy growth to\\nadulthood.\\nAnimals that are not being fed a commercially prepared, nutritionally complete diet appropriate for the species and\\nto ensure their health and well-being need to have a diet plan documented and approved by the AV that is\\nmaintained, followed, updated as necessary for new animals or changes in their age or physiologic needs, and able\\nto be reviewed by APHIS inspectors.\\nThe facility must have an established program of veterinary care which ensures problems are identified and\\ncommunicated to the AV and that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat veterinary conditions\\nare used.\\nThe following animals need to examined by the AV by 14 Jan 2015:\\nTiger Rajah, Tiger Ojaus, Kangaroo Rascal, Leopard Bagheera\\nAll other animals and the nutrition plan for any animals not receiving a commercially prepared diet for their species\\nand physiologic needs must be evaluated by the AV by 2 Feb 2015.\",\n",

She described the tiger as depressed, still\\ndrooling, clear nasal discharge and walking to water but not drinking. The AV diagnosis was abscessed tooth. The\\nAV plan included return later in evening to sedate the tiger and performed a physical examination, collect blood, and\\nperform a dental extraction. After sedation, her physical examination findings included (cid:28)sloppy heart sounds(cid:29), clear\\nnasal discharge, possible cloudy left eye, no wheezing or crackle, but lung sounds were (cid:28)not crisp(cid:29), teeth (cid:28)looked\\ngreat(cid:29), a tiny tear was noted in the upper gum line at left canine; a piece of bone was noted to be wedged in the\\narea and was removed.

       " 'On Tuesday August 19th, 2014 two inspectors from USDA/AC attended the 6pm \\'Tiger Playtime\\' at the facility.\\nDuring this encounter up to 30 members of the public are allowed to sit in an area surrounded by fence panels\\nunder a tent where two tiger cubs (said to be 14 weeks of age and approximately 25-30lbs) were let into the room to\\ninteract freely with the adults and children present. During the show, the licensee was in the area for the first part of\\nthe event with one assistant. When the Licensee left, another assistant entered the area. Before the release of the\\nwhite tiger into the room, the licensee aggravated the tiger by grabbing her by the scruff and bouncing her up and\\ndown on his lap and ground while the tiger hissed, growled, and bit at his glove covered hands. The tiger\\'s ears\\nwere pinned to the side of its head during that part of the encounter and was not acting in a relaxed manner. As\\ndescribed by the Licensee, the tiger was \"pissed off\". While the tiger was agitated, the licensee dropped the tiger in\\nthe lap of the unsuspecting member of the public sitting next to him. The tiger jumped off this man\\'s lap with its ears\\nstill pinned to its head. The tiger then walked away and flopped onto the floor. At this time the tiger\\'s ears returned\\nto a normal un-agitated position and another tiger was released into the room. The tigers walked, played, and\\njumped around on many members of the public. People were lying down next to them, petting them and taking\\nphotos with them during the length of the event.\\nThere were three incidents where members of the public were scratched or bitten during the play time. One older\\nfemale was pawed and mouthed in the face by the white tiger. A young boy (estimated to be approximately 10yrs\\nold) was bitten on the top of his thigh. The child did yell out, pushed the tiger off of his leg, and crawled away\\nrubbing his thigh. One of the assistants asked him if his leg was still \\'attached\\' and teased him about his leg being\\nchewed like a drumstick. The boy continued to pet and play with the tiger. Another bite was to the back of one of the\\ninspectors, which resulted in broken skin and bleeding. Another young boy was approached from behind by the tiger\\nwhere it grabbed both sides of his head at the ears and mouthed the top of his head. In another encounter a tiger\\nwas lying across the back of a female lying on the floor while chewing and pulling on the hair of another woman\\nsitting next to them.\\nThere were several instances where members of the public would rile up the tigers by rough housing with them, or\\nshaking their heads by gripping their faces, and when the tigers would respond in play by swatting with their claws\\nor biting their hands, multiple people responded by \\'swatting\\' the tigers in the face, nose and eye area, or prying\\ntheir mouth off of their hands or arms with their free hand. There were several instances where the tigers would leap\\non top of people lying down, or jump up onto the hips and lower backs of a standing person. Due to the weight and\\nsize of the tigers, the teeth and claws could cause damage and several members of the public did say \"Owe or\\nouch\" during the play time as the tigers swatted, jumped and mouthed the people.\\nWhile the tigers are young and at play with members of the public, the current procedure of letting the tigers walk\\nfreely among so many people with no direct control by the keepers in the area provides an immediate opportunity\\nfor injury to the public by the tigers\\' sharp claws and teeth. There is also a risk to the tigers due to members of the\\npublic providing a \\'discipline\\' response by swatting, pushing or prying off of their mouths. This action by untrained\\nmembers of the public teaches and encourages the tigers to become more aggressive in their play and may result\\nin the tigers becoming more unruly and unresponsive to discipline. Interactions between the tigers and public could\\nbe managed in a controlled manner under the guidance of a trained keeper, but was not observed by inspectors\\nduring the Tiger playtime they attended. Free roaming contact and unregulated discipline given by the public\\nprovides opportunity for an injury to an animal or the public before control of the situation could be gained by a\\ntrained keeper.\\nAfter the \"Tiger Playtime\" at 7pm there was a show with multiple animals where the public was given the opportunity\\nto see and handle other species. The licensee had many of the animals leashed and talked about them while the\\npublic observed. On one occasion a capuchin monkey was tossed onto the lap of a man next to the inspector. The\\nmonkey was on a long leash and was swung from the belt that was around its hips and tossed approximately 6 ft\\nonto the man\\'s lap. Another monkey was twirled around the licensee by it\\'s belt and leash. The lemur was allowed\\nto jump onto people causing surprise reactions by the public. A young coati was allowed to roam free across\\npeople\\'s laps, and a young kangaroo was allowed to roam free in the event area. The public was allowed to hand\\nfeed many of the animals.\\nAnimals may be injured or harmed when interaction with the public is free and uncontrolled. There needs to be more\\ncontrol of the environment and animals when they come in contact with the public. All animals must be handled so\\nthere is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public during exhibition, with sufficient distance and/or barriers\\nbetween the animal and the general public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.',\n",

The fence noticeably stopped at the edges of the travel trailer and did not form a barrier\\nbarring entrance into the trailer containing the sea lions. The inspector observed a drink concessions trailer being dropped\\noff adjacent to sea lion exhibit. Three individuals working on this task identified themselves as employees of the\\nconcession stand and mentioned that they had nothing to do with the licensee’s business. They were seen walking\\nunsupervised around the TRA site in order to maneuver their trailer. After calling the licensee and leaving a voicemail\\nrequesting to conduct an inspection, the inspector knocked on the licensee’s residential trailer and loudly identified herself\\nas an USDA inspector. There was no response from either the residential trailer or the travel trailer holding the sea lions.\\nA quick inspection around the outside of the trailer and surrounding areas confirmed that none of the Sea Lion Splash\\nLLC employees or the licensee were on site. The licensee was called again at approximately 5:47pm EST and a\\nvoicemail was left requesting a return phone call.\\nWhile waiting for an employee to return to the site, the inspector observed that the back of the trailer containing the sea\\nlions, their food and necessary water quality chemicals had no public barrier and was left completely open so that the\\npublic could easily walk approach the trailer containing the 3 sea lions. The trailer door to the freezer storing fish was left\\nopen, and the freezer door was not seen to have a locking mechanism. Furthermore, the trailer door to the transport\\nenclosure housing the three sea lions had been left completely open and any person could easily step into the trailer and\\ninteract with the animals. The sea lions could be heard vocalizing/splashing around and observed from outside the trailer.\\nThe door to their enclosure consisted of thin metal bars that could allow the smaller two sea lions to poke their heads\\nthrough. The width of spaces between the metal bars could allow any member of the public to touch and/or pass food\\nthrough to the animals. Furthermore, under the steps leading up to the sea lion enclosure, a large collection of cleaning\\nand water quality chemicals were being stored. These were within easy access to any passing individual.\\nUntil the licensee’s employee finally arrived, the inspector observed various individuals entering the county fair property\\nthrough an unguarded gate directly across from the TRA set up. There was not a security guard posted at the gate\\nentrance, and the inspector did not observe any readily identifiable security officials patrolling throughout the county fair\\nproperty. Additionally, various employees from different exhibitors/concession stands/fair rides were seen driving golf\\ncarts or walking around the TRA set up.\\nThe complete lack of employee supervision over the animals and the lack of a physical barrier barring entrance to the\\nanimals for a period of almost 4.5 hours severely compromised the safety of the animals. Any member of the public could\\nhave entered the trailer and harmed the animals or have been harmed by the sea lions.
