       "['On the day of inspection, thirteen tigers were kept in pairs (and one group of three in a double enclosure) in\\nenclosures which measure 4 feet high by 8 feet square. The tigers are able to stand up, turn around, and lie down\\nwithout interfering with their cagemate(s); one male tiger was seen sitting in an erect position and had to hunch his\\nhead to avoid hitting the ceiling of the cage. However, these enclosures do not allow the animals to perform normal\\nspecies-appropriate postural behaviors such as stretching to their full vertical height, climb, or perch. During the\\ninspection, the ten tigers performing in the act were seen in their enclosures from 10:30 AM until the 5:30 PM show\\ntime. They were not taken out of their enclosures or allowed into the show ring for exercise or training at any time\\nduring the day. The three additional tigers are juveniles in training, according to the owner, and they are brought out\\ninto the ring for 20-25 minute training sessions 1-2 times each day. There is no other enclosure or pen of any type\\navailable to allow any of the tigers to make normal postural adjustments. The cats were only outside of their\\nenclosures for the duration of the 20-minute performance scheduled to be held twice on the day of inspection. The\\nowner stated that they are on the road typically 8-9 months out of the year in total (breaks interspersed between\\nperiods of travel). The owner also stated that while at their home site, pairs of tigers are let into a large enclosure\\nwith a pool and toys and they are allowed \"play\" time for several hours per day.

In addition to individual effects, the fact that the tigers are housed in groups can present\\nspace concerns because this does not allow them the ability to escape into solitude or to be housed separately if\\nother major compatibility issues arise.

       " 'On 19 August 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per\\nenclosure). Upon arrival, 32 rabbits were noted to be dead; several others were observed by the receiving\\nindividuals to be in some degree of respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were\\nobserved in an undetermined number of animals). The next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also\\nsuspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. An investigation of the\\ncircumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size\\nthan the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow\\nbetween cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. The driver noted the discrepancy in the\\ndimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals\\nwere loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. The driver stopped to observe the\\nanimals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon\\narrival at their final destination.\\nInadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to\\nbreathe normally. Additionally, reduced airflow can cause the ambient temperatures inside the enclosures to\\nbecome too high, even if the temperatures inside the cargo area as a whole are within range (this was the case with\\nthis shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout\\ntransit). Deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the\\nload (33 of 380 animals).\\nThe primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air\\nfor normal breathing. The intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,\\nincluding re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles\\nused to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint\\nlines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation.

The driver at that time did not record any comments about the condition of the animals\\n(i.e., if any were in obvious distress or need of veterinary care). The next observation was upon delivery of the\\nshipment to the final destination at 3:10pm, where it was noted by the receiving party that the 32 animals were dead\\non arrival. The vice president informed the inspector that the observation procedure involves the driver putting a\\nhand in the space between some of the cages to spot-check the temperature. It is recognized by the handler that\\nthe spaces between cages may become overheated compared to the overall temperature recorded by the sensors\\nmounted in the cargo area, and so this is the technique used to ensure the ambient temperature does not become\\nexcessive.\\nThe observations made by the driver for this shipment were inadequate. The time between observations was\\ngreater than 4 hours. Additionally, no notes were recorded regarding the condition of the animals, the air supply,\\ntemperatures, or other standards; it is unclear if animals were exhibiting distress at the time of the observations stop\\nin-transit or not. Animals must be visually observed as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than\\nonce every 4 hours. This is to assure that animals are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient\\ntemperatures are within limit, and all other standards are in compliance, and to determine whether any animals are\\nin obvious distress or in need of immediate veterinary care. Failure to observe the animals within the prescribed\\nfrequency can result in unseen stressors or unknown conditions to affect the animals and cause undue stress,\\ninjury, or death. Correct by ensuring the driver or other employee of the intermediate handler will visually observe\\nall live animals as frequently as circumstances dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to assure that animals\\nhave sufficient air and ambient temperature to allow normal breathing.

No further treatment or special consideration was noted in the records. Although it was weighed\\nweekly there was no additional diagnostic testing or treatments provided (such as continued analgesics, individual\\nhousing, the addition of soft bedding, nutritional support, additional monitoring etc.) despite weight loss. The rabbit\\nweighed 5.8# Friday 8/23/13 and there was no record of veterinary examination for this weight loss. The rabbit was\\nkept through the weekend and until the study ended for that group Tuesday 8/27/13. This animal may have\\nexperienced pain or distress during the period it was maintained without treatment as indicated by 12% weight loss\\nbetween weighing 8/16/13 and 8/23/13.\\nThese three rabbits all had weight loss that could indicate pain or distress.

During\\nthe cardiac bypass there was a notation that the animal was kicking. A paralytic was administered with the\\nanalgesic and increase in the anesthetic agent. As stated in the protocol the analgesia and anesthetic should be\\nallowed to bring the animal to plane III anesthesia before the administration or re-administration of a paralytic to\\nensure the animal is not experiencing pain during the surgical procedure.\\nSheep B3382 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/11/14. Both the\\nheart rate and the blood pressure increased after the cardiac bypass and remained at that level until the end of the\\nsurgery, about 45 minutes. The heart rate increased from an average of 73 to 106 and the blood pressure\\nincreased from an average of 79/50 to 102/76. During the 45 minute period with the elevated heart rate and blood\\npressure the gas anesthetic was decreased from 2% to 1% for the last 30 minutes. No additional analgesics were\\nadministered during this 45 minute period. An additional dose of paralytic drug had been given during the cardiac\\nbypass so the sheep would have been under the influence of the paralytic. Pain was then not appropriately\\naddressed in this sheep, the sheep should have received an agent for pain relief which would lead to a decrease\\nthe heart rate and blood pressure.\\nSheep B3386 had thoracic surgery that included several administrations of a paralytic drug on 6/13/14. After the\\nincision the average heart rate increased from 92 to 144 and the average blood pressure increased from 83/61 to\\n119/101. An analgesic was given to decrease the pain and the resulting high blood pressure. Five minutes later\\nthe heart rate was 149 and the blood pressure 112/91. Metoprolol (not an analgesic or anesthetic) was given to\\ndecrease the high heart rate and blood pressure. The use of Metoprolol was not included in the protocol. Eight\\nminutes later the heart rate was 103 and the blood pressure was 106/79 and an additional dose of the paralytic drug\\nwas administered. The cardiac bypass was initiated four minutes later. As the protocol indicates, an increase in\\nheart rate and blood pressure indicates perception of pain by the animal. The increase in heart rate and blood\\npressure were considered signs that the sheep was experiencing pain. Giving a drug that affects heart rate and\\nblood pressure prevents these parameters from being used to monitor pain when paralytics are used. The sheep\\ndid not have its pain addressed before additional paralytic was given.\\nParalytic agents prevent the animal from moving even if it experiences pain. Heart rate and blood pressure often\\nincrease when animals experience pain and are therefore used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia in lieu of muscle\\nresponses such as eye twitch. When heart rate and blood pressure rise during anesthesia, additional pain relieving\\n(analgesic) and/or anesthetic agent are necessary to assure the animal is not experiencing pain. This is especially\\nimportant in animals that are unable to respond due to a paralytic agent. Based on the examples above, the\\nveterinary guidance on use of paralytics to include monitoring with appropriate response does not appear to be\\nadequate as required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. Each research facility veterinarian must provide\\nguidance on appropriate monitoring and subsequent treatment by personnel involved in handling, immobilization,\\nanesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia. This assures the least pain and distress is felt by the animals.\\nCorrect for all future surgeries.\\nAn exit briefing was conducted with the facility Vice President and facility Veterinarian.\\nAdditional Inspectors\\nMiller Dana, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist\\nGeib Mary, Veterinary Medical Officer',\n",
