       " '*on june 29, 2021 at approximately 11:30 am the inspectors looked at the dairy cows comprising the veterinary teaching\\nherd. one black and white overweight cow (ear tag #5483) was noted lying sternal very close to the fence/gate leading to\\nthe covered student palpation stalls. the rest of the cows were located down the hill near the hay and water sources.\\nnatural shade and shelter areas (trees) for the cows were available but were far away from the cows and located down a\\nhill, across parts of two pastures and up another hill. cow #5483 had a respiratory rate of 88 breaths per minute (normal\\n10-30) and was exhibiting flaring of the nostrils. the dairy caretaker went into the enclosure to get her to stand up. she\\nstood with her neck extended breathing heavily, nostrils flaring. her respiratory rate at this time was 100 breaths per\\nminute. the caretaker opened the gate and she along with the other cows went under the covered palpation stalls where\\nthey had access to shade, food, and water. the temperature was 82 degrees with 63 percent humidity. a large animal\\nveterinarian was contacted. he examined the cow at 3:45pm and diagnosed her with heat stress due to high humidity,\\nbeing overweight and warm temperature. the access to shade appeared to improve her condition enough (respiratory\\nrate 60, heart rate 84, and body temperature 101.2 according to records) that she was able to be returned to her pasture\\nthat day.\\nanimals subjected to combinations of excessive temperature, humidity, and time, taking into consideration such factors as\\nhealth status and body condition issues, can present a threat to an animal’s health and well-being. the cows need to be\\nhoused and handled in a manner to avoid causing overheating, stress, and unnecessary discomfort.\\n*the iacuc meeting minutes from the march 18, 2021 meeting include a discussion about an adverse event that\\noccurred on feb. 4, 2021. the principal investigator did not report the event to the iacuc until february 18th. the\\niacuc conducted a review of the event. on feb. 4, 2021 the principal investigator (pi) and lab staff on protocol 20-100\\nused six gottingen pigs in a study involving traumatic brain injuries. the first pig used died during the procedure and\\nblood was noted on the intubation tube. the staff made positioning changes for the second pig who also died with “more\\nblood” noted. the pi team continued to troubleshoot and make changes to the study procedures. in total only two of the\\nsix pigs used survived. at no point during the six procedures was the attending veterinarian notified of the adverse events\\noccurring. the continued study manipulations and handling of the pigs after the initial unexpected death led to potentially\\npreventable deaths and pain (surviving pigs). the two pigs that did survive exhibited abnormal neurological signs.\\nfollowing anesthetic recovery, a veterinarian’s assessment of these signs included ataxia (incoordination), weakness in\\nall four limbs and mild/moderate mental depression. one pig was noted trembling. the veterinarian prescribed pain\\nmedication for both pigs.\\n**handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,\\noverheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.\\ncorrect by 7/15/21.',\n",
       " 'on 19 august 2014, the intermediate handler transported a load of 380 rabbits in 190 cartons (2 rabbits per\\nenclosure). upon arrival, 32 rabbits were noted to be dead; several others were observed by the receiving\\nindividuals to be in some degree of respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were\\nobserved in an undetermined number of animals). the next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also\\nsuspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. an investigation of the\\ncircumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size\\nthan the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow\\nbetween cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. the driver noted the discrepancy in the\\ndimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals\\nwere loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. the driver stopped to observe the\\nanimals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead upon\\narrival at their final destination.\\ninadequate space in the cargo space used to transport animals can have a significant impact on their ability to\\nbreathe normally. additionally, reduced airflow can cause the ambient temperatures inside the enclosures to\\nbecome too high, even if the temperatures inside the cargo area as a whole are within range (this was the case with\\nthis shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout\\ntransit). deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the\\nload (33 of 380 animals).\\nthe primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air\\nfor normal breathing. the intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,\\nincluding re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles\\nused to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint\\nlines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and ventilation. the drivers have been trained and instructed not to\\naccept a shipment if these criteria are not met.\\nto be corrected from this time forward.',\n",

respiratory distress (blue discoloration, panting, and frothing at the nose were\\nobserved in an undetermined number of animals). the next day one additional rabbit also expired, which was also\\nsuspected to have been caused by the respiratory stress experienced in transit. an investigation of the\\ncircumstances of the shipment revealed that the primary enclosures used to house the rabbits were of a larger size\\nthan the intermediate handler had anticipated, so the cargo area of the truck was too small to allow adequate airflow\\nbetween cages and subsequent ventilation to the animals housed therein. the driver noted the discrepancy in the\\ndimensions of the boxes that had been ordered vs. those that had been delivered for shipment, but the animals\\nwere loaded onto the truck despite this, and the transport proceeded as planned. the driver stopped to observe the\\nanimals mid-shipment and no abnormalities were noted; however, the 32 rabbits were discovered to be dead

shipment, as no temperature alarms were noted -(cid:19) the temperature was recorded within range throughout\\ntransit). deficiency in airflow and adequate ventilation caused significant animal impacts, i.e., the loss of 9% of the\\nload (33 of 380 animals).\\nthe primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must be positioned in a manner that each rabbit has sufficient air\\nfor normal breathing. the intermediate handler has taken corrective measures to prevent further incidents,\\nincluding re-training all of the drivers and painting a pattern of lines on the walls of the cargo areas of the vehicles\\nused to transport animals, such that any primary enclosure must be fitted inside the areas designated by the paint\\nlines in order for there to be sufficient airflow and

cage wash was not functioning properly but was\\nstill being used to sanitize the primary enclosures of 3 white rabbits. according to staff, the instrument used to\\nmeasure the temperature inside the cage wash was not functional, and maintenance was having difficulty in finding\\nthe correct part to fix the cage wash; however, the cage wash was still being used as the primary means to sanitize\\nthe rabbit\\'s enclosure. in the cage wash records, the last temperature test strip used was marked on april 29th\\n2014. when questioned about the reason temperature test strips had not been used since, the staff said it was\\nbecause the cage wash would not consistently reach 180 degrees fahrenheit. a detergent called steris cip 200 (a\\nclear fluid in white container) was also being used in the sanitation process, but no disinfectant was used for the\\nprimary enclosure. by not having a cage wash that can reliably reach 180 degrees fahrenheit or not using a\\ndisinfectant, the rabbit primary enclosure cannot be appropriately sanitized. proper sanitization is vital in removing\\nharmful pathogens that can serve as an opportunity of infection for the animals in the enclosure. proper sanitization\\nremoves all sources that promote pathogen presence and growth. the rabbit(cid:25) primary enclosure must be sanitized\\nat least every 30 days by either hot water (180

scan\\nprocedure. the iacuc self-identified that there was non-compliance with the facility’s iacuc policies and a failure\\nto follow the protocol. the animal was under anesthesia during the procedure and there were gaps in physiological\\nmonitoring (i.e. sp02, pr, rr, etco2, body temperature and bp) based on the records, which should have\\noccurred every 15 minutes. for example, there were no entries on anesthetic monitoring recorded between 3:47 am\\nand 4:26 am (39 minutes); there were no entries for temperature or etco2 from 3:47 am to 8:20 am (4 hours, 33\\nminutes); and there was a lack of physiologic monitoring recorded between 7:00 am to 8:20 am (80 minutes). also,\\nthe animal experienced ongoing complications such as hypothermia, hypotension, wet lung sounds and fluid in the\\nendotracheal tube during the anesthetic procedure. the first documented rectal temperature near the start of the\\nprocedure at 3:47 am was recorded as 95.7 degrees f. although a bair hugger had been placed on the animal\\naround 4:25am, the next recorded temperature continued to be decreased at 94.8 degrees f at 8:20 am. although\\nthe animal’s temperature began to slowly increase after
